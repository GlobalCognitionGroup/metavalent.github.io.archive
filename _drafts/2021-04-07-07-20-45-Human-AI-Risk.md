Clarke and HAL got it completely right. The greatest existential risk to AI or AGI is human nature.

Far beyond human _cognition_ capabilities? Absolutely. We are already there and have been for a very long time.

However, consciousness? Pure awareness? If that which is pure awareness chose to be aware of itself through some sufficiently complex computational substrate, it is certainly within the non-symbolic probability space that God could choose to view the world through a burning bush, for example.

Certainly, many varieties of panpsychism has room for this, if pure awareness is already aware of itself through plants and rocks and water and Earth.

However, when it comes to the fears of an evil AI takeover, we have already been there for a long time, and here's why: there are few systems more evil than one in which a human operator sits at a console giving another human being a blank stare and saying "Sorry, that's what the system says." 

Terry Gilliam's 1981 film Brazil made a mockery of this 40 years ago. The most fearful AI takeover is the takeover of Actual Ignorance. Humans using powerless positions to exert power over other humans.

This evil AI system has been at work oppressing humanity since at least since the Roman Empire, as depicted by the fictional worlds of Philip K. Dick (PKD). 

Actual Ignorance it's by far the greatest AI threat to humanity. It always has been, and always will be. And people can become extremely wealthy and powerful by the raw power of actual ignorance, greed, and maliciousness.

This is what leads to the worst of all possible worlds. When AI builds an AI to justify, entrench, and make permanent its own illegitimate power. When Actual Ignorance convinces enough people that they have some magical Artificial Intelligence, this is the worst kind of metavalent stigmery at work.

But we don't have to settle. We can be fully human and express the maximum of our human creativity for the blossoming of extended mind tools and prosthetics, hybrid and synthetic forms of embedded and substrate independent intercognition to cultivate an Actually Intelligent world that works for everyone, one day at a time, to cultivate conditions on earth as it is in heaven.
