In this absolutely transcendent discussion between Dr's Zubin Damanian and Federico Faggin, below, it's easy to conclude that Arthur C. Clarke got it completely right, again, in his timeless computer character [HAL 9000]({{site.ddg.search}}"HAL 9000"). What he got right:

> The single greatest, perhaps even sole existential risk to AI or AGI is human nature. Blaming the machines is a convenient excuse to dodge our own personal accountablity for the kind of world we've inherited, and the kind of world we're cultivating, while we're here for a minute. 

Are computers capable of performance far beyond human _cognition_ capabilities? Absolutely. That's been the case since the dawn of computing. Humanity crossed that Rubicon the moment a computer began solving simple mathematical equations faster than human calculators. Yes, even the term _calculator_ originated as a human feature and functions; that's how deeply human everything about computing is, in essence. Equally human is, in the case of strong paternal or maternal bonds, the profound PTSD incurred by the incomprehensible loss of a parent or loved one. The temporary nature of biological embodiment has long vexxed and perplexed humans, and has led to countless ways to imagine the continuation of embodied life. From reincarnation, to resurrection, to mind-uploading substrate-independence. Perhaps, from an infinite perspective, each and every one of them is true, in an infinite multiverse; who can know what each individual conscioussness needs in order to understand and make sense of its own journey? Certainly not this interstitial meme-seeding artist of 5D probablity space. The salient point here is, when any of these transcendencies assert themselves into the world inU.S such a way as to limit human sovereignty, a boundary conditions is breached; because, as recognized and perhaps best articulated in the U.S. Declaration of Independence as "certain unalienable Rights" which are "endowed by their Creator."

> The gratification and vindication of hearing one of the literal Fathers of Silicon, and hence The Valley, validate what we've long held to be self-evident can't be overstated. The _True Self_ of all computers and computation is _us_. Human beings. Our own _True Self_, is the next abstraction layer out, and part of this conversation even dares to boldly go there.

### Why Does Any Of This Matter?

The way we view the world matters because our worldview _literally creates the world_. It was uncanny to hear Dr. Faggio use one of my own favorite words for this, it's the German language word: [weltanschauung]({{site.ddg.search}}weltanschauung). Considering the weight of worldview in the actual experience of our world, from the most selfish perspective, leads me to the following: if I have to live in this world with other beings co-creating such a realm, I simply can't afford to have a critical mass continuing to believe in and perpetuate a hellish realm of extraction, depletion, war, scarcity, lack, intentionally engineered economic precarity, poverty, relentlentless judging, labeling, stereotyping, and Bullshit _Justifications Of Being_ (JOBs). See the 2018 David Graeber book by that very title, [_Bullshit Jobs_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs). If such is the current state of any particular realm I may inhabit, I'm going to be incredibly motivated to do something to change the suffering to sufficiency, denial to discernment, ignorance to insight, foolishness to fruitfulness.

Now we can get back to consciousness, from which, and within which, all of the phenomenological world is unfolding. Unfolding as these bits are barely etched in silicon, sublimely stored, and received via the reflected light of this screen, as you read.

Can silicon ever be conscious? If that which is pure awareness chose to be aware of itself through some sufficiently complex computational substrate, it is certainly within non-symbolic probability space that pure awareness could choose to view the world through a burning bush, if it so chose. It follows that many varieties of panpsychism make room for this, as pure awareness from that perspective is already aware of itself through plants and rocks and water and Earth.

However, when it comes to the fears of an evil AI takeover, we have already been there for a long time, and here's why: there are few systems more evil than one in which a human operator sits at a console giving another human being a blank stare and saying "Sorry, that's what the system says." 

Terry Gilliam's 1981 film Brazil made a mockery of this 40 years ago. The most fearful AI takeover is the takeover of Actual Ignorance. Humans using powerless positions to exert power over other humans.

This evil AI system has been at work oppressing humanity since at least since the Roman Empire, as depicted by the fictional worlds of Philip K. Dick (PKD). 

Actual Ignorance is by far the greatest AI threat to humanity. It always has been, and always will be. And people can become extremely wealthy and powerful by the raw power of actual ignorance, greed, and maliciousness.

Yes, artificially intelligent, high frequency trading (HFT) bots on Wall Street have been endowed and imbued with human agency for a very long time. HFT's are computational intelligences, imbued with human meaning and intention, driving stock markets to all-time highs for the benefit of the handful of their human owners. In this circumscribed context, the Actually Ignorant Artificially Intelligent (AI-AI) takeover is already fully manifest.

This is the context in which every working American lives, wether conservative or liberal, canceled or coddled, red, white, blue, green yellow, purple.

Here's how to check this conjecture: observe all the stock market charts. Compare what they communicate to your own individual direct experience. Do you feel the sense of infinite liberating growth and expansion in your own life that those charts convey? Or do you experience the opposite? Do you feel the crushing demand to get up every morning and do something that you dislike or even despise in order to avoid the fate of being evicted? Do you feel sentenced to this fate forever and ever?

This is what leads to the worst of all possible worlds. When Actual Ignorance AI contracts to build Artificial Intelligence AI to justify, entrench, and make permanent its own illegitimate power. When Actual Ignorance convinces enough people that they have some magical Artificial Intelligence, this is the worst kind of metavalent stigmery at work. We can and must reverse engineer this process, then deploy effective countermeasures, in order to achieve a flourishing human commensurate with our true nature. True nature, as described by all of the great religious and philosophical traditions of human history.

"We are taking advantage of it [quantum computing] but we don't know what's going on.‚Äù &ndash; Frederico Faggio.

If that's not the favorite position of evergy Actually Ignorant villain with power and money, I don't know what is. A magic box, a cheat code, a Dark Crystal that just keeps supporting ignorant, illegitimate power, without regard for potential consequence.

"Why does anyone want to be a machine? That's what you accept when you accept being a machine, and therefore, better machines will control you. And behind those machines are people who like to monetize you." &ndash; Frederico Faggio.

But we don't have to settle for any of this. We can be fully human _and_ express the maximum of our human creativity for the blossoming of extended mind tools and prosthetics, hybrid and synthetic forms of embedded and substrate independent intercognition to cultivate an Actually Intelligent world that works for everyone, one day at a time, to cultivate conditions on earth as it is in heaven.

How? By the same process of metavalent stigmergy that got us to this present moment of apparent pandemic exhaustion and burn-out.

One realization at a time. As a critical mass of individuals understands that humanity is sovereign over _all_ of our creations, including computation, humanity awakens from this nightmare.

1:03:00 "Part-Whole" is holographic, per Lawrence Krauss and Ken Wilbur's "whole-ons." 

Because of the symmetries we observe throughout all other phenomena that we're capable of observing might not make sense that there would be reflective symmetries into the quantum realm? That is, holographic principles applied in a quantum context.
