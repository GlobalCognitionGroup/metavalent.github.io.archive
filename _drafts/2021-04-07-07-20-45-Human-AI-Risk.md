In this down-to-earth and transcendent discussion between Dr's Zubin Damanian and Federico Faggin, below, it's easy to conclude that Arthur C. Clarke got it completely right, again, in his timeless computer character [HAL 9000]({{site.ddg.search}}"HAL 9000"):

> The single greatest, perhaps even sole existential risk to AI or AGI is human nature. Blaming machines is a convenient excuse to dodge our own personal accountability for the kind of world we've inherited, and the kind of world we're cultivating, while we're here for a minute. There are few things more evil in the present world than a human sitting a screen saying, "Sorry, that's what the system says." Utterly stripped of the capacity for human judgment and agency. This isn't the doing of computers, this is the doing of shareholders. Shareholders demand maximum return on capital at every and all expense, including human; but more on that later.

### A Mini Meta Commentary

Apropos this site's theme, a brief mini meta-commentary:

> When it comes to computers and consciousness, my early fascination with Ray Kurzweil's version of substrate-independence was dramatically cut short and severely tempered as I contemplated the many terrifying ramifications to finding one's consciousness permanently contained in some kind of static substrate, through which one cannot continue one's journey toward pure awareness and the revelations of understanding the nature of true self. Yikes! These scenarios range from, "just uploaded my brain into a Boston Dynamics robot, only to find that I have no access to any of the five senses, so I'm now going full Terminator on the rest of you," to "feeling pretty good in the new robot substrate; sensory inputs are well emulated, but now that I'm here, I'm immediately faced with the question of: now what? Even in the new substrate, I can only read and retain so much at a time, because of the attention bottleneck of the present moment, and I always despised my own flesh to such an extreme degree that _i opted for this_, so not feeling super inclined to be of service to billions of ungrateful meat-bots, frankly." 

On the other hand, reflecting on [this conversation](#) with Dr. Faggin raises both new questions and potential understandings, including a potentially surprising alternative to the Kurzweil Brain Trap, above.

> _How can we reasonably place any limit on the number of potential paths of awareness available to an infinite, omniscient, omnipresent, consciousness to explore? While human qualia is unique and perhaps quantum-privacy-constrained, how can we know whether or not other varieties of qualia are possible?_

Computers have long been capable of performance far beyond human _cognitive_ capabilities. That's been the case since the dawn of computing. Humanity crossed that Rubicon the moment a computer began solving simple mathematical equations faster than human calculators. To further humanize computing, remember that even the term _calculator_ originated as a [human function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuntala_Devi); that's how deeply human everything about computing is, in essence. We need to remember and re-emphasize all of this in the 21st century, in order to roll back the vile narrative that humans are "_like computers_." 

> Stop. Reverse that. Computers, networks, WiFi, all of it, are "_like humans_."

The salient point here is, when _humans_ frame computational capabilities in such a way as to effectively limit human life, liberty, informed consent, agency, happiness, and even sovereignty, a hard boundary condition is breached; namely, the U.S. Declaration of Independence principle that all human beings are "endowed by their Creator, with certain unalienable Rights." Computers aren't eroding these intrinsic rights, the owners and operators of those computers, networks, data centers, apps, and mobile devices are doing that; and the damage is already a global cultural pandemic of its own; a pandemic far more deadly and pernicious than COVID-19; and the underlying, precipitating environment that ensures a COVID-23, or COVID-27, of increasing devastation, until enough human beings recognize that even the COVID-19 pandemic is a _symptom_ of this cultural pandemic. Container ships blocking the Suez Canal are just one of countless other comorbidities asserting themselves with increasing 

> The gratification and vindication of hearing one of the literal Fathers of Silicon, and hence The Valley, validate what we've long held to be self-evident can't be overstated. The _True Self_ of all computers and computation is _us_. Human beings. Our own _True Self_, is the next abstraction layer out, and part of this conversation even dares to boldly go there.

### Why Does Any Of This Matter?

The way we view the world matters because our world-view _literally creates the world_. It was uncanny to hear Dr. Faggio use one of my own favorite words for this, it's the German language word: [weltanschauung]({{site.ddg.search}}weltanschauung). Considering the weight of worldview in the actual experience of our world, from the most selfish perspective, leads me to the following: if I have to live in this world with other beings co-creating such a realm, I simply can't afford to have a critical mass continuing to believe in and perpetuate a hellish realm of extraction, depletion, war, scarcity, lack, intentionally engineered economic precarity, poverty, relentlessness judging, labeling, stereotyping, and Bullshit _Justifications Of Being_ (JOBs). See the 2018 David Graeber book by that very title, [_Bullshit Jobs_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466958-bullshit-jobs). If such is the current state of any particular realm I may inhabit, I'm going to be incredibly motivated to do something to change the suffering to sufficiency, denial to discernment, ignorance to insight, foolishness to fruitfulness.

Now we can get back to consciousness, from which, and within which, all of the phenomenological world is unfolding. Unfolding as these bits are barely etched in silicon, subtly stored, and received via the reflected light of this screen, as you read.

### Can Silicon Ever Be Conscious?

Can silicon ever be conscious? My response differs a bit from both doctors. Here's why. If that-which-is _pure awareness_ chose to become aware of itself through some sufficiently complex computational substrate, it is certainly within non-symbolic probability space for it to do so. For that matter, one biblical text proclaims, "if these [people] keep silent, the stones will cry out [in praise]!" ([AMP](https://biblehub.com/luke/19-40.htm)). If stones can be made to express acknowledgment of Pure Awareness, why can't silicon? Isn't silicon made from melted down tiny sand-stones, after all? Believe me, I understand how utterly absurd it sounds for a nobody like me to differ with this man:

> "Federico Faggin is a physicist, engineer, inventor, entrepreneur, and author. He developed the MOS Silicon Gate Technology at Fairchild (1968) and designed the world's first microprocessor at Intel (1971). Faggin also founded and led Zilog, Synaptics, and other high-tech companies before starting the Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation (2011) dedicated to the scientific study of consciousness" ([Silicon, The Book](https://siliconthebook.com/)).

But it gets even more narcissistic than that. I believe that I might partly or entirely persuade Dr. Faggin to this view, within certain parameters.

In addition to the reference to stones, above, there are also accounts of pure awareness expressing itself through and apparently-burning bush. We say apparently, because who knows what that phenomena might have actually been like. It may be that the analogy of fire was simply the closest at hand, for such an awe-struck observer. It follows, then, that many varieties of panpsychism also make room for this sort of thing, as pure awareness takes form of all things, plants, rocks, water, and Earth. Now, one may reasonably reject panpsychism, and yet still the biblical versions of stones and bushes afire with the light of consciousness remain. These too may be rejected, but there they stand, to be considered one way or the other.

### The Evil AI Meme

I also differ with my colleagues in this video, when it comes to the fears of an evil AI takeover. From the perspective I'll now describe,  we have already been there for a long time, and here's why: there are few systems more evil than one in which a human operator sits at a console giving another human being a blank stare and saying "Sorry, that's what the system says." 

Terry Gilliam's 1981 film Brazil made a mockery of this 40 years ago. The most fearful AI takeover is the takeover of Actual Ignorance. Humans using powerless positions to exert power over other humans.

This evil AI system has been at work oppressing humanity since at least since the Roman Empire, as depicted by the fictional worlds of Philip K. Dick (PKD). 

Actual Ignorance is by far the greatest AI threat to humanity. It always has been, and always will be. And people can become extremely wealthy and powerful by the raw power of actual ignorance, greed, and maliciousness.

Yes, artificially intelligent, high frequency trading (HFT) bots on Wall Street have been endowed and imbued with human agency for a very long time. HFT's are computational intelligences, imbued with human meaning and intention, driving stock markets to all-time highs for the benefit of the handful of their human owners. In this circumscribed context, the Actually Ignorant Artificially Intelligent (AI-AI) takeover is already fully manifest.

This is the context in which every working American lives, wether conservative or liberal, canceled or coddled, red, white, blue, green yellow, purple.

Here's how to check this conjecture: observe all the stock market charts. Compare what they communicate to your own individual direct experience. Do you feel the sense of infinite liberating growth and expansion in your own life that those charts convey? Or do you experience the opposite? Do you feel the crushing demand to get up every morning and do something that you dislike or even despise in order to avoid the fate of being evicted? Do you feel sentenced to this fate forever and ever?

This is what leads to the worst of all possible worlds. When Actual Ignorance AI contracts to build Artificial Intelligence AI to justify, entrench, and make permanent its own illegitimate power. When Actual Ignorance convinces enough people that they have some magical Artificial Intelligence, this is the worst kind of metavalent stigmery at work. We can and must reverse engineer this process, then deploy effective countermeasures, in order to achieve a flourishing human commensurate with our true nature. True nature, as described by all of the great religious and philosophical traditions of human history.

"We are taking advantage of it [quantum computing] but we don't know what's going on.” &ndash; Frederico Faggio.

If that's not the favorite position of evergy Actually Ignorant villain with power and money, I don't know what is. A magic box, a cheat code, a Dark Crystal that just keeps supporting ignorant, illegitimate power, without regard for potential consequence.

"Why does anyone want to be a machine? That's what you accept when you accept being a machine, and therefore, better machines will control you. And behind those machines are people who like to monetize you." &ndash; Frederico Faggio.

But we don't have to settle for any of this. We can be fully human _and_ express the maximum of our human creativity for the blossoming of extended mind tools and prosthetics, hybrid and synthetic forms of embedded and substrate independent intercognition to cultivate an Actually Intelligent world that works for everyone, one day at a time, to cultivate conditions on earth as it is in heaven.

How? By the same process of metavalent stigmergy that got us to this present moment of apparent pandemic exhaustion and burn-out.

One realization at a time. As a critical mass of individuals understands that humanity is sovereign over _all_ of our creations, including computation, humanity awakens from this nightmare.

1:03:00 "Part-Whole" is holographic, per Lawrence Krauss and Ken Wilbur's "whole-ons." 

Because of the symmetries we observe throughout all other phenomena that we're capable of observing might not make sense that there would be reflective symmetries into the quantum realm? That is, holographic principles applied in a quantum context.
