Do not be yourself. Be The Self.
The I Am says, I am that I am.
The Christ says, if you have seen me, you have seen the Godhead, the father.
The Christ says, I in you, as the Godhead, the father is in me.
So, if others see us, they have seen that.
When the teacher is ready, the student appears.
The body is a classroom.
The body is both a learning device and teaching device.
The body is and instrument of effort and acceptance.
The body-mind is an interface of sense and nonsense.
We sit in the middle of all of it.
The reason that the first minutes of meditation feel like forever is because they are.
It is the first time that we are touching forever, and it feels a bit overwhelming, doesn't it?
It's okay. We are happy, we are healthy, we are confident, we are light, we are love.

When we inhabit all of this, we can sit in pure awareness, without the fear that we will "lose the content."
We can let go of the impulse to annotate, to capture, to freeze-frame, to insta-snap-tok every fleeting moment.
We can let all that go and see it for what it is, without judgment. 
All experience is learning and teaching, at the same time.
We are here to liberate one another. To set one another free.

"If you get too much information, too soon, without the proper containment, and guidance, and interpretation, it can create a lot more problems than you had to begin with. So, the growth and development of consciousness needs to be managed properly. This was the role of gurus, and priests, and mulas, and lamas, in the old days. Nowadays, it's DIY, and people have an extreme experience and can't integrate it." &mdash; Shunyamurti
