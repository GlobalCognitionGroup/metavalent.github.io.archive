Why do we react so dramatically differently to each of these pandemics and epidemics? What's happening here? If we are cultivating "conditions on Earth as it is in Heaven," please raise your hand if you believe that the first thing God says upon reaching Heaven is, "get a job or get out." Please point me to that place in scripture where Jesus said to passers by, "get real job you lazy slob." Please show me where Jesus said, "Oh, your economic life is precarious? Prove you are my disciple by Getting a Job."

The reason we can know that vaccines were developed so quickly had absolutely nothing to do with concern for human life is the fact that not a finger has been lifted toward alleviating much more tragic human suffering due to far more obvious and addressable causes.
