Krishnamurti asks, "to what are you attached?"

> I am attached to the acquisition of knowledge and the articulation of words to convey concepts through the noosphere.

"To understand the meaning of ending, of negation. So, while living, can you negate attachment *completely*? That means living with death. To negate something that is untrue. To negate your double talk. So your brain has this quality of integrity. So death is an ending that has extraordinary purpose in life. Not suicide. Not euthanasia. The ending of your attachment your pride, your antagonism for another, your hatred for another. When you see It holistically, there is total freedom from death, not from the ending of the body, but from fear."
