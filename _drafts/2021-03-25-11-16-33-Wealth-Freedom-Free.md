The moment that a plurality of human beings, currently in positions of being pressured and pushed to beat the previous quarterly numbers, sparing no human expense, could understand this; *that*, is what will change the world to a better ride. In an instant. Not by any sophisticated program or lengthy process, but instantly.

It's not out of our control. Those of us in this position literally have the power to change the world. The world just needs *us* to "get this," and act upon it. 

When is it enough? 1 million? 10 million? 1 billion? 100 million? A trillion? When, will it ever be, enough?

The very moment in which I can stop demanding more and more *for* myself, is the moment I can stop demanding more and more *from* others.

It's time for a 2021 remix of #StopTheMadness And this time, the madness is greed, ignorance, and self-hatred, self-loathing, self-fear, which is then externalized and projected upon others; creating pandemics of suicide and desperation and hate crimes, all stemming from our own hatred of our own selves, because we have *otherized* in such a way that catastrophically fails to recognize that harming others is literally harming ourselves. 

It's not theoretical. It's not hippie woo woo. It is the laws of physics, which arise from the laws of metaphysics. Tesla was correct in name-calling Albert Einstein a metaphysician. And, empirically, it turns out that the metaphysicists are correct. Do your own homework. Reach your own conclusions. The truth is in there. Inside your authentic curiosity and desire to know the nature of that which is.
