TIL there are about 8 billion humans on Earth, each granted, on average, less than 3 billion seconds (95 years) of embodiment.

That means, if I met one new person every second of my life, I would only ever meet about 1/3 of the human beings currently on the planet.

So, the odds of meeting you the way I met you, are pretty extraordinary.

We can interpret that mathematics to mean that none of us are of any measurable significance whatsoever, we are all relatively worthless, anonymous and indistinguishable specs of dust, so, we might as well all melt into mud.

Or, we can interpret the unique value of one person cherishing the unique value of one person, is one of the rarest gems in existence.
