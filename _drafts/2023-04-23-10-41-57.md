TIL there are about 8 billion humans on Earth, each granted, on average, around 2 billion to 3 billion seconds of embodiment. That's a range of 63 to 95 years.

That means, if I met one new person every second of my life, I would only ever meet about 1/4 to 3/8 of the human beings currently on the planet.

So, the odds of meeting you the way I met you, and the number of seconds and years of this seemingly individual life that I have experienced the privilege and responsibility, the difficulties and triumphs, of sharing these experiences with you, are pretty extraordinary.

We can perhaps interpret that mathematics to mean that none of us are of any measurable significance whatsoever, we are all relatively worthless, anonymous, interchangeable, indistinguishable specs of dust, so, we might as well just all melt into mud and be done with illusory feelings of human dignity or worth.

Or, we can interpret the unique value of one cherishing the unique value of one for the duration of those brief couple of billion seconds, as one of the rarest gems in all existence.

Can it be both, and?

Maybe. Or not.
