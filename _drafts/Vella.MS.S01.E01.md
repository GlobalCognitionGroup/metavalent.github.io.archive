What if we could literally write reality into existence?

Impossible? All powerful? Or impossibly complex and fraught with the dire responsibility for unanticipated consequences of literally every thought and action we take?

This series aims to experiment with, and explore the liminal fringes of the increasingly blurred lines between what we experience and accept as every reality &ndash; referred to as Default Consensus Reality, throughout &ndash; and what is possible. Where an infinite multiverse spontaneously spawns infinite probabilistic adjacent realities, moment to moment, day to day, week to week, year to year, lifetime to lifetime. In this particular adjacent reality, I'll work hard to ease up on the obsessions with alliteration, neologisms, and runaway sesquipedalianism. As in, "that new person we just met was such a self-proclaimed know-it-all and sesquipedalian that no one could understand a word that they said. Sesquidpedalian. Way too impressed with long, fancy words. Remember, I said I'll work hard at it, to what extent we'll succeed remains to be seen. And so, on with the the show.
