### What if the big bug in capitalism is this tiny chunk of broken code?

Started this thought process several years ago and procrastinated. In my 2018 book, "[Where We Go From Here, Chaos to Community](https://amzn.to/2URmAjL), I explain in detail why this bug *is* the bug and suggested that we could fix it. Anticipating major inflection points in the capabilities of AI, I outlined guidelines for upgrading the Social Security system to a self-funding, market-indexed universal basic income generating and circulating system.

With a bounty on the line of salvaging what's helpful about capitalism for human flourishing, while surgically removing the harmful, red team identified a bankster backdoor vuln in 29 U.S. Code § 1104. Hence, appealing first to my higher power to find some way out of the assignment and failing, today started with the following prompt to [godmode.space](https://godmode.space/) an "Easter project inspired by #AutoGPT & #BabyAGI" built by [@_Lonis_](https://twitter.com/_Lonis_/status/1646641412182536196):

* PROMPT: Pass a law that changes 29 U.S. Code § 1104, subsections (a), (a)(1), (a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(A)(i),(a)(A)(1)(ii), (a)(1)(B), (a)(1)(C) to replace the principles of shareholder primacy with the principles of stakeholder governance, consistent with B corporation legal framework.*

After capturing a few screen shots, I somehow allowed myself to be ADD'd or otherwise distracted away from the process and had to start over. Starting over didn't go well. Apparently it's not a very forgiving digital godmode.space and I didn't feel cozy signing in with any of offered SSO options, so I Google Lens'd a couple of the screen-shots and asked [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/) to format.

### An A.I. generated BILL to replace shareholder primacy with the principles of stakeholder governance, consistent with the B Corporation legal framework, and for other purposes.

H.R. [BILL NUMBER] - To replace shareholder primacy with the principles of stakeholder governance, consistent with the B corporation legal framework, and for other purposes.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

[DATE]

A BILL

To replace shareholder primacy with the principles of stakeholder governance, consistent with the B corporation legal framework, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Stakeholder Governance Act of [YEAR]".

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

For the purposes of this Act, the following definitions shall apply:

(a) 'Stakeholder Governance' means the framework for management and decision-making that prioritizes the interests of a wide range of stakeholders, including but not limited to, shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, the environment, the community, and future generations.

(b) 'Director' means a member of the board of directors of any corporation.

(c) 'Officer' means any officer of a corporation, including but not limited to, the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer.

#### That's a nice first cut to break the writer's block, but it ain't a BILL yet

I realized that I failed to prompt for the focus on redefining Fiduciary Duty and the Prudent Man Standard of Care in a way that protects all Directors of all Corporations, of any kind, from adverse legal consequences of considering any other values beyond shareholder primacy.

*PROMPT: I will give you DEFINITION-1 of shareholder primacy as contrasted with stakeholder theory, followed by DEFINITION-2, the current fiduciary duties prudent man standard of care. I will then ask you to RE-WRITE those duties and standards in a way that protects all Directors of all Corporations, of any form permitted under U.S. law, from adverse legal consequences of considering and prioritizing other values in addition to shareholder benefit. This will not in any way prevent any U.S. Corporation from operating under the principles of shareholder primacy, rather, it will expand the options available to Directors and Stakeholders such that free capital markets may make their choices as to what values they wish to express and implement in the practice of free enterprise.

DEFINITION-1: For the purpose of this assignment, Shareholder primacy is a corporate governance philosophy that emphasizes the primary responsibility of a corporation's management and board of directors is to maximize the value and returns for its shareholders. This perspective asserts that the interests of shareholders should take precedence over those of other stakeholders, such as employees, customers, suppliers, and the community.

This approach is often contrasted with stakeholder theory, which argues that corporations have a broader set of responsibilities and should balance the interests of various stakeholders, rather than solely prioritizing shareholders. Understand that Shareholder primacy has been widely debated and criticized for potentially leading to short-termism and neglecting social and environmental concerns in the pursuit of profit.

This is the end of DEFINITION-1.

DEFINITION-2: 29 U.S. Code § 1104 - Fiduciary duties

(a)Prudent man standard of care
(1)Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and—
(A)for the exclusive purpose of:
(i)providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and
(ii)defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan;
(B)with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;
(C)by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so; and
(D)in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III.

This is the end of DEFINITION-2.

Please RE-WRITE.

#### Background

In addition to our 2018 book, "[Where We Go From Here, Chaos to Community](https://amzn.to/2URmAjL), published under a Hawaiian pen-name for probably absurdly autistic yet reasonable-seeming-at-the-time reasons, we'll offer just a few more footnotes to this project.

"BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s highly regarded annual letter to CEOs (2022) highlights [stakeholder corporate governance](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/01/21/stakeholder-governance-and-purpose-of-the-corporation/): 'In today’s globally interconnected world, a company must create value for and be valued by its full range of stakeholders in order to deliver long-term value for its shareholders. It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term.” Fink also calls attention to the importance of centering corporate purpose in this context, stating, “Putting your company’s purpose at the foundation of your relationships with your stakeholders is critical to long-term success.'"

This mirrors [Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance] long-held opinion regarding the purpose of the corporation, which can be summarized as follows:

The purpose of a corporation is to conduct a lawful, ethical, profitable and sustainable business in order to enable its success and increase in value over the long term. This requires consideration of all the stakeholders who are critical to its success (shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and communities) as determined by the corporation and its board of directors using their business judgment and with regular engagement with its shareholders, who are essential partners in supporting the corporation’s pursuit of its purpose. Fulfilling this purpose in this manner is fully consistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of directors, and the concomitant stewardship obligations of shareholders.

29 U.S. Code § 1104 - Fiduciary Duties

(a) Prudent person standard of care

(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge their duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of:

(A) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and

(B) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan; while

(C) consistent with the principles of stakeholder governance.

(a)(1) Fiduciary responsibilities

In discharging his duties, a fiduciary shall act:

(A) Consistently with stakeholder governance principles, including:

(i) considering the interests of the corporation's employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where the corporation operates, as well as the long-term interests of the corporation and its shareholders;

(ii) adopting and implementing sustainable business practices to promote the welfare of the environment and society as a whole, while minimizing adverse impacts on stakeholders;

(B) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;

(C) by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so.

(D) in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III.

The revised section now reflects the principles of stakeholder governance, consistent with the B corporation legal framework. The fiduciary is required to consider the interests of various stakeholders and implement sustainable business practices to promote the welfare of the environment and society as a whole.
