### What if the big bug in capitalism is this tiny chunk of broken code?


"BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s highly regarded annual letter to CEOs (2022) highlights [stakeholder corporate governance](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/01/21/stakeholder-governance-and-purpose-of-the-corporation/): 'In today’s globally interconnected world, a company must create value for and be valued by its full range of stakeholders in order to deliver long-term value for its shareholders. It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term.” Fink also calls attention to the importance of centering corporate purpose in this context, stating, “Putting your company’s purpose at the foundation of your relationships with your stakeholders is critical to long-term success.'"

This mirrors [Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance] long-held opinion regarding the purpose of the corporation, which can be summarized as follows:

The purpose of a corporation is to conduct a lawful, ethical, profitable and sustainable business in order to enable its success and increase in value over the long term. This requires consideration of all the stakeholders who are critical to its success (shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and communities) as determined by the corporation and its board of directors using their business judgment and with regular engagement with its shareholders, who are essential partners in supporting the corporation’s pursuit of its purpose. Fulfilling this purpose in this manner is fully consistent with the fiduciary duties of the board of directors, and the concomitant stewardship obligations of shareholders.

29 U.S. Code § 1104 - Fiduciary Duties

(a) Prudent person standard of care

(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge their duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of:

(A) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and

(B) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan; while

(C) consistent with the principles of stakeholder governance.

(a)(1) Fiduciary responsibilities

In discharging his duties, a fiduciary shall act:

(A) Consistently with stakeholder governance principles, including:

(i) considering the interests of the corporation's employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where the corporation operates, as well as the long-term interests of the corporation and its shareholders;

(ii) adopting and implementing sustainable business practices to promote the welfare of the environment and society as a whole, while minimizing adverse impacts on stakeholders;

(B) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;

(C) by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so.

(D) in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III.

The revised section now reflects the principles of stakeholder governance, consistent with the B corporation legal framework. The fiduciary is required to consider the interests of various stakeholders and implement sustainable business practices to promote the welfare of the environment and society as a whole.
