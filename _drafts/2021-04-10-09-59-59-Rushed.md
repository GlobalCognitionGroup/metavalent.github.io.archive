What is the nature of that which we call rushed? Hurried?

Sitting quietly, from whence arises this feeling of being rushed?

How is it possible to suddenly feel rushed, hurried, mildly frantic?

So I pondered, after a second cup of caffeinated English breakfast tea.

Taking a breath, lowering the shoulders, I discover [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1356551/).

> Caffeine and the central nervous system: mechanisms of action, biochemical, metabolic and psychostimulant effects.

> Caffeine increases energy metabolism throughout the brain but decreases at the same time cerebral blood flow, inducing a relative brain hypoperfusion.

> The effects of caffeine on learning, memory, performance and coordination are rather related to the methylxanthine action on arousal, _vigilance_ and fatigue. Caffeine exerts obvious effects on _anxiety_ and sleep which vary according to individual sensitivity to the methylxanthine.
