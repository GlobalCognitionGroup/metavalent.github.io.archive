As Marshall McLuhan said 60 years ago, we are always driving by the rearview mirror. 

We may all begin fallen and flawed. However, we are not _further_ fallen or more _deeply_ flawed because of the time and place we happen to be born into this present default consensus reality. Fallen is fallen and flawed is flawed. There is no useful function or utility for algorithms such as, "yeah, but _those_ people."

"Those people," are us. Projections and reflections of our own state of awareness and consciousness. 

If E Pluribus Unum is the motto of the United States, perhaps E Unum Pluribus is the motto of the human race.
