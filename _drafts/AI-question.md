Follow up question: Because of the symmetries we observe throughout virtually all of natural phenomena, at least that which we're capable of observing, might it not make sense that there would be reflective symmetries into the quantum realm? That is, holographic principles applied in a quantum context? In fact, what is referred to as "part-whole" and "whole-on" seems to be consistent with holography, wherein every chip of the film contains the whole. Seems like a nice integration point with other parallel theories.
