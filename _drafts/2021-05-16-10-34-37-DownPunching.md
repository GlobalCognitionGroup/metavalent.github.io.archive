RNN producer Maximilian Alvarez breaks it down, sharing how he awoke from the #JobTrance that so many of us were raised in.

It's never been the fact that *nobody wants to work,* it's that nobody wants to be a chump working for chump change, going back into the meat grinder, being told to shut up and do as we're told, by the very people who say to us, "you can't tell me what to do!" Said with a completely straight face and no sense of self-awareness, let alone irony. Incredible.
