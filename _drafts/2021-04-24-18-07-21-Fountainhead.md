The best description of the [message of The Fountainhead](https://youtu.be/Pl3x4GINtBQ?t=1h26m55s), to bright and promising youth that I've ever heard.

Like Taron, I read the books out of order. Not on purpose, just that's how it happened. LOL.

[Yaron says](https://youtu.be/Pl3x4GINtBQ?t=1h38m30s),"This guy has the blood of 100,000 people on his hands. To me a Nazi and a communist or the same thing." First of all, the Communists were fighting the Nazis, so that's just beyond ignorant, ipso facto. How many human beings has the American empire killed since World War I? Or since the Vietnam War? Or just so far in the 21st century?
