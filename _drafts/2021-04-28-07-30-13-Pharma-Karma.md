title: The COVID Pharma Karma Cycle of Misinformation and Doubt
---

Dare to even write about logical fallacies, inconsistencies, and plain old lies of convenience to cover up for supply chain failures, and to be downranked or deep platformed.

That's what dementia-directed narcissistic CULT-ures do. We are all living in one big Winchester Mystery House now.

I honestly need you to tell me which part of this I have wrong, because the entire purpose of this open inquiry is an attempt to discern the nature of how experiential realities emerge and are experienced by experiencers.

The default consensus reality narrative appears to have gone along these lines:

- Wearing masks protects others. The reason we wear a mask is to not spread the virus. Remember, you can be symptom free or even immune, and still transmit the virus. Wear a mask, above all.
- We finally have developed a virus. Remember, it doesn't mean you can't transmit the virus so please keep wearing your mask. The number one thing that prevents transmission is wearing a mask.
- If you get vaccinated, you can stop wearing your masks in public. As long as you're good, forget everybody else. Ah, finally, back to narcissistic self-centered American normal. I'm good,f you.

Here's [what the CDC website says](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html) as of the moment of this writing:

> We’re still learning how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19. After you’ve been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, **you should keep taking precautions — like wearing a mask**, staying 6 feet apart from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces—in indoor public places until we know more.
