One company isn't even shy about it. The company is literally called PREY. Not even shy about it. Just call remote workers what they've become: [PREY](https://preyproject.com/blog/en/employee-monitoring-surveillance-for-the-remote-work-era/ ). It's likely that the only people who don't realize that #RemoteWorkerSurveillance amounts to #HouseArrestJobs are so privileged that they don't know anyone in this situation.

But wait, there's more.

Remote work isn't less demanding, it requires even MORE engagement, [according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2021/12/27/this-is-the-future-of-remote-work-in-2021/?sh=ce8d1131e1de).

While common sense psychology for human well being is obvious. "Often forgotten as working remote typically yields you thinking that if you arenâ€™t in front of that computer 24/7, you are not being productive. When you were [in the office, how many times would you stand up to walk around, grab something to drink, have a snack](https://preyproject.com/blog/en/employee-monitoring-surveillance-for-the-remote-work-era/ ), go out for lunch? Keep the same routine while working from home, your brain and well-being needs the rest."

There is no keeping the same routine in today's remote work _worst practice_ best practice.
