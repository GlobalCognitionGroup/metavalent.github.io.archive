"Reality may not be something that we're as in touch with us we think we are.” — Sam Harris

I can't lie. It's pretty gratifying to see an intellect of the caliber of Sam Harris independently reaching similar conclusions about consciousness that we reached 20+ years ago. That's not a competition, we landed on the planet in different time frames. 

It's simply a gratifying independent finding, as is always the case in science, when someone else independent replicates our own and other colleagues results.
