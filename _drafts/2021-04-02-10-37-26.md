An IRL FanFic-Maybe-NotFic Joint, based on the [Medium publishing universe] (https://link.medium.com/HvPPQJai8eb) work of [Jessica Wildfire](Mmm).
Just another typical day. Woke up, had a cup of coffee, read the entire internet for updates. Today's theme seems to be:

It's billionaires gone bunkers! Panoptic private surveillance and impenetrable private security armies! Electromagnetic spectrum Dark Zones, legislated by Dark Money, for maximum lulz and sex trafficking! What could possibly go wrong?

In a given universe where some non-trivial proportion of such activity is taking place, what's perhaps most tragicomic is the fact that, somewhere inside, the very people building the bunkers – like pyramid laborers – have got to know that they won't have a place in the bunker; and yet participate in their own extermination in the name of, "it's a job, and everybody *has* to have a job."

This is what has been described as the #JobTrance, for at least the past decade. Through a blue lens over the left eye, this is also what has been described as an inherently toxic and unsustainable default consensus reality. Through a red lens over the right eye, it's just pure evil, principalities and powers. Perfectly predictably. Prophesied.

Mammon gonna' mammon.

Riveted series fans, on the edge of their seats question, "will the numbers of #PostAutomationEra Rip Van Winkles reduce fast enough to prevent a self-fulfilling catastrophe?"

The audience knows that each participant posseses the individual agency to decide within their own hearts, whether or not to reconcile with brothers and sisters, or to manifest Armageddon. Which will they choose? Dig in, and literally be willing to kill brothers and sisters, yet again, or maybe look around and see that we are each the fruit of the same human tree of lfe, all in the same predicament, the same context, inhabiting the same collective frame of reference; for identical sociological, cultural, and environmental reasons?

Stay tuned for the next exciting episode of, "Earth the Sixth Mass Extinction Event." Episode 2021.04.04: "Well, Do Ya, Punk?"
