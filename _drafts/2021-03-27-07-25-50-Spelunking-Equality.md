What are the natures of freedom and equality, in the context of Earth, 2021? Consider these two videos, together, without prejudice or bias.

From this perspective, we have seen a lot of confusion over the phrase *equality of outcome*. Universal [social security](https://Chaotic immunity.com/) is emphatically and empirically **not** equality of outcome; yet is somehow occasionally perceived and depicted as such by those who benefit from the present State of Affairs.

#### Engineered Economic Precarity

Engineered economic precarity has served the ruling class of America well, for over a quarter of a millennium.

Engineered economic procurity has resulted in suicide becoming the second leading cause of death for people between the ages of 21 and 45, as of 2020.

Engineered economic precarity resulted in the vulnerability that made the United States the single most afflicted nation, in the case of a pandemic. And rest assured, a worse pandemic will come, one day. Perhaps in a year, perhaps in a decade, perhaps during our children's lifetime. It *will* happen, because pandemics have *always* happened on planet Earth, and will always happen from time to time. It's simply the fact of the matter. It's also the fact of the matter that each generation is born ignorant of the previous generations, and it is not always simple to transfer knowledge in a way that is understood, respected as authentic, and therefore taken seriously.

The hucksterism and commodification of literally everything, in order to sell, sell, sell, has exacerbated the distrust between generational knowledge transfer. This does not bode well for a species that is so highly dependent upon intergenerational knowledge transfer for its survival.

#### The Ending Of An Era

Bankers and money changers who co-opted Christianity to provide sheep's clothing for the capitalist wolves of Wall Street have long been handsomely rewarded; flying in their private jumbo jets and pontificating from their golden pulpits and crystal cathedrals.

Some people are referring to this time as a Great Reset, some people are referring to this time as the true dawning of the Age of Aquarius, some people are referring to this as a time of spiritual Reformation and Revival, we have dubbed all of these, and more, as features of the #PostAutomationEra.
