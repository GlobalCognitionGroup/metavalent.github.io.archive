This is one of the absolute pinnacles of the primacy of projection and paradox. Amazing. None of this is exclusive to romantic relationships by any stretch. We often gravitate back into friendships with people that literally, physically, and emotionally, will resemble our own parents; even if we know our parents were toxic, because it's what we are most familiar with in our deepest wiring.

A more clinical take, applying Assortment theory and the Five Factor Model, etc. Yep. Initial, Positive Assortment is highest with machiavellianism, then psychopathy, then narcissism. Grandiose vs. Vulnerable narcissism. Reminding that all of these traits exist on a spectrum.

Knowing what the right and moral position is, but actually not holding it in ourselves, only displaying it for public consumption.
