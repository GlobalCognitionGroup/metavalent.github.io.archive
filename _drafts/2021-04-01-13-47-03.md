### This is what Global Cognition Groups Look Like

From this perspective (FTP), [Curt Jaimungal's](https://www.patreon.com/curtjaimungal) self-deprecatingly described "_irresponsible_" project called [Theories Of Everything](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheoriesofEverything/featured) &ndash; which he may be taking to the next level with the whimsically named [TOE Clippings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdITf9DoFmndXy7nXWIoa7g/featured) spin-off &ndash; is perhaps one of the best examples of what many of us envisioned when we imagined what a healthy, functional #GlobalBrain could become. A colloborative cognition space, a noosphere, in the service of advancing human discovery, inquiry, and understanding. More precisely, collaborative _intercognition_, contemplating the nature and purpose of the human predicament and what to do about it.

A mutually-enriching process for exploring humanity's most fundamental questions. From the simplest &ndash; not always the easiest &ndash; to the deepest questions and greatest challenges. [Cultivating Earth's greatest benefit. Extending humanity's best potential.](https://GlobalCognitionGroup.com). Bringing the affordances of new kinds of A.I. augmented, 100% human capacity to bear upon challenges which no single human mind is even capable of containing, let alone processing or solving. For those who may find this type of content too speculative: firstly, it's early days; and secondly, the format can be brought down to earth, so to speak, in terms of branching into collaborative mathematical problem set sessions and other open-ended academic inquiries that bring independent self-guided learning into this 21st century [#PostAutomationEra](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PostAutomationEra&src=typed_query).

This kind of self-directed, open-access to higher education has long been modeled by some of the world's leading thinkers, working on some of the most challenging problems. Both [Jeff Hawkins]() and [Stephen Wolfram](https://www.facebook.com/wolframresearch/) have made live, real-time R & D meetings open to anyone who would like to join in. You can join [The Wolfram Physics Project Working Sessions](https://www.wolframphysics.org/livestreams/) or the [Numenta Research Meetings](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialNumenta/).

These are practical, existing, working examples of how to heal, mature, and address the [Social Dilemma](https://TheSocialDilemma.com) of our troubled, distracted, combative adolescent Global Brain. But here's the key:

> Motivations must pivot. Priorities must re-org. We have arrived in the #PostAutomationEra, but not everyone has realized it, yet. The good news is, there are rapidly declining numbers Rip Van Winkles remaining. Despite the spite of an embittered boomer decline, have hundreds of millions of **Global Millenials and Digital Natives** to thank for improvement of almost all of the most meaningful and pragmatic _human aspects_ of navigating this disruption, this inflection point in human cultural history, into an entire new era of humanity. Welcome to the Post-Automation Era.

Curt's version of modeling real-time intercognition is unique, and FTP, revolutionary, in that it attracts a slightly larger audience than other mere podcasts, or more specialized research groups, and is actively modeling and cultivating a kind of productive intercognition that can potentially &ndash; in our optimistic view &ndash; significantly help to heal and grow beyond the troubled, solipsistic, discordant, adolescent Global Brain that we are all familiar with, which we are all more than ready to leave as a mostly bad memory, back in the teens (2010's).

We might even suggest that this is an example of Curt's _Global Cognition Group_ in action. A GCG isn't a proprietary thing. It's the 21st century version of what was once called Mastermind, now augmented with Extended Mind. Today, we all have access to countless GCG's, and the cultivation of our own GCG's perhaps represents another kind of new literacy in this new era.
