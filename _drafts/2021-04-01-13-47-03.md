### This is what Global Cognition Groups Look Like

From this perspective, [Curt Jaimungal's](https://www.patreon.com/curtjaimungal) self-deprecatingly described "_irresponsible_" project called [Theories Of Everything](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheoriesofEverything/featured) -- which he may be taking to the next level with the whimsically named [TOE Clippings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdITf9DoFmndXy7nXWIoa7g/featured) spin-off -- is perhaps one of the best examples of what many of us envisioned when we imagined what a healthy, functional #GlobalBrain could be; in the service of advancing human discovery, inquiry, and understanding. Collaborative intercognition, contemplating the nature and purpose of the human predicament, toward exploring humanity's deepest questions and perhaps addressing some of our greatest challenges; challenges which no single mind is even capable of containing, let alone processing. For those who may find this content too speculative, the format can be brought down to earth, so to speak, in terms of branching into collaborative mathematical problem set sessions, and other open-ended academic inquiries that bring independent self-guided learning into this  #PostAutomationEra.

We might even suggest that this is an example of Curt's Global Cognition Group. A GCG isn't a proprietary thing. It's the 21st century version of what was once called Mastermind, now augmented with Extended Mind. Today, we all have access to countless GCG's, and the cultivation of our own GCG's perhaps represents another kind of new literacy in this new era.
