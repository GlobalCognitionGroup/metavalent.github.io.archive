### This is what Global Cognition Groups Look Like

From this perspective (FTP), [Curt Jaimungal's](https://www.patreon.com/curtjaimungal) self-deprecatingly described "_irresponsible_" project called [Theories Of Everything](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheoriesofEverything/featured) &ndash; which he may be taking to the next level with the whimsically named [TOE Clippings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdITf9DoFmndXy7nXWIoa7g/featured) spin-off &ndash; is perhaps one of the best examples of what many of us envisioned when we imagined what a healthy, functional #GlobalBrain could become. A colloborative cognition space, a noosphere, in the service of advancing human discovery, inquiry, and understanding. More precisely, collaborative _intercognition_, contemplating the nature and purpose of the human predicament and what to do about it.

A mutually-enriching process for exploring humanity's most fundamental questions. From the simplest &ndash; not always the easiest &ndash; to the deepest questions and greatest challenges. [Cultivating Earth's greatest benefit. Extending humanity's best potential.](https://GlobalCognitionGroup.com). Bringing the affordances of new kinds of A.I. augmented, 100% human capacity to bear upon challenges which no single human mind is even capable of containing, let alone processing or solving. For those who may find this type of content too speculative: firstly, it's early days; and secondly, the format can be brought down to earth, so to speak, in terms of branching into collaborative mathematical problem set sessions and other open-ended academic inquiries that bring independent self-guided learning into this 21st century [#PostAutomationEra](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PostAutomationEra&src=typed_query).

This kind of self-directed, open-access to higher education has long been modeled by some of the world's leading thinkers, working on some of the most challenging problems. Both Jeff Hawkins and Stephen Wolfram have made live, real-time R & D meetings open to anyone who would like to join in.

Curt's version is unique in that it attracts a slightly larger audience, and is actively modeling and cultivating a kind of productive intercognition that can potentially &ndash; in our optimistic view &ndash; help to heal and grow beyond the troubled, solipsistic, discordant, adolescent Global Brain that we are all familiar with, back in the teens (2010's). Check it out here.

We might even suggest that this is an example of Curt's Global Cognition Group. A GCG isn't a proprietary thing. It's the 21st century version of what was once called Mastermind, now augmented with Extended Mind. Today, we all have access to countless GCG's, and the cultivation of our own GCG's perhaps represents another kind of new literacy in this new era.
