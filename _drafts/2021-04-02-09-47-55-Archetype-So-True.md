"The archetype is so true, it applies to the archetype itself." â€” Curt.  A good clips candidate @CloserTo Truth

Curation value, and cultivating platform-liberated community around engaging content feels like a thing in the 2020's. Clearly, with 2.3 billion daily users, and the cacophony of 500 hours of video uploaded every minute, the only way we get introduced to another human being like Curt is through AI and serendipity. "The AI" is our FOAF friend in common. The serendipity is that non-symbolic aspect of human experience that represents the frontiers of both contemporary physics and consciousness, intersecting in the space of Theories Of Everything, as they are. Isn't it?
