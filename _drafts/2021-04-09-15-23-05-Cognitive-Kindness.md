Karen Yu: "It's about no less than cognitive justice.‚Äù Not in the endless sadistic punishment sense that are insane narcissistic culture has drifted into, but in the _freedom sense_ of having the right to our own minds, and our whole minds.

([12:22](https://youtu.be/E4IyZ0df3ks?t=12m22)) "Fundamentally, cognitive kindness is more than any
single act
it's a philosophy that elevates the
value of our minds and the possibilities
they represent
it asks us to consider what we do in the
context of how it affects the ability of
others
to use their minds as fully as they wish
toward what they wish cognitive kindness
reminds us that
true inclusivity is more than simply
offering someone a seat at the table it
requires
intentionally designed interactions
processes and spaces that actually
empower each person's full cognitive
potential
it's about no less than cognitive
justice
