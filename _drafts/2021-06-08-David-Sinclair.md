Over the past few decades, my views have changed about this topic. It's a bit ironic that the shorter the time remaining on my own basic biological clock, the less interested I've become in wildly extending the shelf-life of this particular costume. I'm not particularly *against* extending healty life, either; it's just that my views have become a lot more nuances.

The engineering aspect of our bodies continues to be as interesting and compelling as ever. How could such a marvelous machine not be captivating? At the same time, particularly given the mathematical completion &ndash; or, at least, reaching a dead-end in the maze &ndash; of the standard model of physics, and the unavoidable prevalence of the Observer Effect in what we previously considered the "hard, cold, reality," of the material realm. Add to this, the intriguing mathematical work in the domain of Conscious Realism, by researchers such as Donald D. Hoffman, and there has been plenty of advancement over the past 20 years for one's scientific views to be updated; as the data indicates that our earlier views may have been either extremely under-informed, or just plain wrong, right?
