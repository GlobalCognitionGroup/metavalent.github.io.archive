There seems to be a tendency to confuse what we mean by the instantiation of new *default consensus realities.*

This is not a proactive program, it is an observation, of the way that nature works. Observing conditions on the planet for the past 60 years has provided us enough data points to see that *metavalent stigmergy* is the process by which people come to believe things in common, on a widespread basis.

To be angry about metavalent stigmergy is like being angry about mitosis. there's nothing to be angry about. Cells divide, and that's how biological life transpires.

Consensus, by definition, cannot be coerced.

Consensus, in the largest context, as a kind of default mode network of shared awareness of the world, is largely unconscious, to most of the population.

The current *default consensus reality* agrees that the sky is blue.
