It has come to our attention that there seems to be a tendency to confuse what we mean by the instantiation of new *default consensus realities.*

This is not a proactive program, it is an observation, of the way that nature works. Observing conditions on the planet for the past 60 years has provided us enough data points to see that *metavalent stigmergy* is the process by which people come to believe things in common, on a widespread basis.

To be angry about metavalent stigmergy is like being angry about mitosis. There's nothing to be angry about. Cells divide, and that's how biological life transpires.

By definition, authentic consensus between fully informed conscious agents, cannot be coerced.

Default consensus reality is also merely an observation. Default consensus realities are a kind of default mode network of shared awareness of the world. Default consensus realities exist within families, within tribes, within villages, within cities, counties, states, nations, and ultimately the world.

Default consensus realities tend to be largely unconscious, to most of any given population. They are shared assumptions and presumptions about *how the world is*.

One current *default consensus reality* agrees that the sky is blue. Another prevalent default consensus reality is that we live in a world of conflict and strife. Both of those, appear to be empirically true, at the moment. Also, there are changes to the climate that could literally change the color of the sky. There are changes to the way we interact with one another in a society that literally could cultivate conditions on Earth as it is in heaven.

Those changes would cultivate a new default consensus reality; not because anyone convinced anybody of anything; not because anybody forced anybody to do something differently; but because causes and conditions changed.

That's it. That's all there is to this sense of consensus. So, anyone who attempts to frame our work as trying to shove something down somebody's throat is simply lying to you; most likely out of fear, or because they perceive they are losing some form of illegitimate power. Because, whatever you call this period of time, the dissolution of illegitimate power is rapidly accelerating, just as light rapidly dispels darkness. The sun rising in the morning is not an act of violence, it is a daily reminder of that which is.

As light shines forth in the darkness and the darkness cannot comprehend it, so it is in the hearts and minds of all sentient beings. For those with hearts to perceive, even the darkness is not darkness, for the nature of omnipresence is omnipresence. There is an energy that precedes even darkness and light, and there is an awareness that precedes even thought. We'll meet you there.

We have no program, yet may participate in many kinds of programs, in alliance and partnership. We are primarily observers of the changes underway. Nothing more, nothing less.
