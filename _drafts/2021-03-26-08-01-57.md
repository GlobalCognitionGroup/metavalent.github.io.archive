Today's realization. That said TO me, is not always directed AT me. People are performing their experience in front of me, not necessarily because of me. Whether I'm a son of a narcissistic family system, and a Golden Child or Scapegoat, with high inherited narcissism myself, of course I assume that it's all, always, about me, and coming at me. I am the eternal target and victim.

Can I let this go in the light of heaven? Of course. Will it always be part of the story I share with others of how I got into heaven? Of course. Do all the experiences that I had on my way to heaven "ruin heaven" in any way? That, doesn't even merit a response. Heaven, by definition, is incorruptible. Of course, that characteristic is exactly what triggers so many damaged beings to forever attempt, in vain. 

Now is the moment to let go of the painful childhood cartoon images of an inaccessible, impenetrable, condemning heaven, and integrate everything that you have learned from science, physics, and exploration of all the great world philosophies and traditions and arrive yourself, in this very instant.

Welcome home.
