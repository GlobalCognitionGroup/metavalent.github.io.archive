How online and mainstream beer & cigar *[man-o-sphere](https://metavalent.com/2021/03/19/13-53-00.html)* and hyper-commercialized *socialization agents* [encourage and cultivate an increasingly narcissistic and psychopathological culture](https://youtu.be/RhRS3Ziv8xg?t=10m20s) among both men and women, with a focus on the manufacture of *fake alpha males*.

Also, a bunch of fascinating data on how people actually use hookup apps.

* Actually, it's men that want long-term relationships much more than women.
* Men average message length is 12 words. Women 121 words. LOL.
* Women have the most one-night-stands, probably because of absurd ratio of men-to-women of almost 10-to-1.
* Women initiate 73% of divorces because they feel being single empowers them. (Of course it does. Options. LOL.) 
* Not all too surprising, actually, when you think about it. :satisfied:
