Headlines like "BlackBerry blackout could be costly" and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/02/01/technology/rim/index.htm?cnn=yes">Government again states fears about a BlackBerry shutdown</a> are so stupid as to qualify as insulting to any thinking human being.  If these BB users are so hip and smart and adaptable, then they'll surely find a way continue doing their job -- more likely, they fear having to GO BACK to doing actual work instead of thumb-twiddling their way through life.
