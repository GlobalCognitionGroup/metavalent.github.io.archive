This is such [a wonderfully compassionate, kind, and nuanced approach](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4) to this topic. Much needed. The polarizing misunderstandings around this challenge are so rampant, that it is difficult to sort the signal from the noise.

That's one of the primary purposes of this website. To curate content that is worth your time, and by delivering that curation value, continue building communities of value.

### It's a Spectrum, not a Death Sentence

The spectrum of narcissism – the giving and receiving of narcissistic injuries – is a complicated and widely misunderstood topic. In this podcast, Alan refutes a lot of the oversimplified labels and offers a much-needed and nuanced approach to these culturally metavalent ailments.

Like other issues in mental health, our collective denial and avoidance of openly exploring personality disorders, cultivates precisely the kind of out of sight out of mind, twilight, dimmed, darkened, moldy breeding ground that, in general, invites all manner of unpleasant things thrive in. 

Sunlight and air are the best medicines, and heaven knows that right now, our civilization could use better, more holistic medicines.

I promise that [this is so worth listeneng to](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4), and may be one of the most important themes of public conversation in the 2020's, if we're to begin making changes for the better.

### Highlights

* ([05:10](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=5m10s)) "I'll simultaneously be folding myself into this too because I understand this process the narcissistic wound which is different from narcissistic abuse which is different from trying to pathologically diagnose someone with a personality disorder it's not what I'm talking about ..."
* ([05:40](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=5m40s)) "it's that very wound that all of us experienced all of us suffer two sides of the same coin ..."
* ([07:33](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=7m33s)) "we're gonna look at how we all have a narcissistic wound whether or not we call ourselves narcissists whether or not we call ourselves empaths whether or not we call ourselves codependence and I don't like this language I don't think it's helpful ..."
* ([12:33](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=5m10s)) "I am going to continue to talk about how that is an an underlying core theme of this _misguided unconscious rage this primal rage_ that is folded into the narcissistic wound and that is then playing out and part of the communities that want to talk about it and so I've had a boundary I do not want that energy leaking into the community ..."
* ([13:07](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=13m07s)) "the the guiding principle that I endorse is called self-directed healing and really looking at healing as a lifestyle and saying you know we need to take ownership for our own maturing our own our own personal growth and we are continuing to __*water the seeds of better health and water the seeds of better healthy relating*__ so in order to do that it's really important to know how some of this residual toxicity and this unknown anger and rage can leak into when we start talking about healing attachment injuries and healing attachment trauma ..."

### You are not welcome to be you

* ([16:24](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=16m24s)) "chronic stress and anxiety around money and finances, and poverty, and it just creates an environment where the parent is just totally distracted and so your self, you, __you are not welcomed to be you__ ... in addition ... the environment in some way was potentially hostile to you being yourself, or the environment was so unattentive that you started to question subconsciously your little child mind well _there must be something wrong with me_, I mean, these people don't even see me, these people don't engage me, and this can become really incredibly crazy-making and complex ..."
* ([19:01](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=19m01s)) "we must not deserve love, _there must be something wrong with me_, and all of these core beliefs _linked to a really provocative, horrible, nauseating uncomfortable feeling that +there's something fundamentally wrong with who I am_, that _I am flawed as a human being_ and I'm talking about shame ..."
* ([20:55](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=20m55s)) "then we just shut down; this complete sense of, well, you know, _I guess I can't even be me_ and we shut down so much that we don't even realize we are shut down. We don't even realize there's a skill to opening up, we are shut down so much -- and here we go here's a big part of this whole thing I'm talking about -- __*the narcissistic wound creates a false self*__ and that's how we all then develop, saying, well I can't be really myself, and when I've attempted to have my attachment needs met, and I've attempted to connect with my parents in a certain way, and I've attempted to want to share who I am, and be vulnerable and open up emotionally ... that's not working ... these people are just checked out; these people are distracted; these people are self-absorbed; and remember that word, because it's a direction that we're going here; that's the sort of the link and the crossover with narcissism; that word again ... not narcissistic abuse ... but this idea about narcissism is this: __our development of self was thwarted, so we then need to enter a state of absorption to be able to make choices about what we do next__. We can't don't really have a freedom or fluidity to know how to let the self just be its self, to let ourselves just to be our selves ..."

### Everyone has it, and so you ... don't have Permission to Exist

> * ([23:26](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=23m26s)) "we can even say that it's even normal, that __it's really normal to have a narcissistic wound__ and it's very easy to make the argument to say __everyone has it__ ... in modern culture, we're living in a very immature psychology ..."
* ([24:32](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=24m32s)) "the wound is that, we never had a reference point for really knowing who we really were, and as a result we kept reinforcing and believing, because the environment around us was unwelcome, or maybe even hostile, is that we got the sense that we are going to be *fundamentally rejected as a human being*, and *this is life or death stuff*, so, therefore, the conclusion, the really, really intelligent conclusion is: __"I cannot be myself. I will be rejected and I will die here."__ Therefore, how do I develop this other false self" so that I can simply be allow PERMISSION TO EXIST?!
* ([25:48](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=25m48s)) "my false self, my persona self is going to overcompensate, I'm gonna be an overachiever, and I'm gonna be a little (or a lot) grandiose, and I'm really gonna be a lot of jazz hands, and bells and whistles, and *I'm too much for this world*, and I'm gonna make sure that you notice me. So, we have a presentation that's really sophisticated and dynamic, and we're even moving [toward] -- do you see the connection -- we can see how then some people can very easily choose to become manipulative, or manipulate environments to get what they want. Because that's what they needed to get their attachment needs met, and say hey notice me; I know how to make you notice me."
* ([26:32](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=26m32s)) "Now, there's also the other avenue, the other direction. The person who implodes into themselves, and they disappear. They want to stay under the radar. I've heard a number of stories of people growing up who had this ongoing relationship with hiding; literally hiding in parts of the room, hiding behind furniture; a particular closet where they would sit next to the shoes and hang out with the the long hanging coats, so that when someone opened the door they didn't even see that they were hiding in there. That's literal, but also metaphorical or symbolic of [the way] we to just hold back, don't reveal who you are. __*All of this is folded into this narcissistic wound*__ and just to repeat, we're doing [this] in a context where the parent themselves are unaware of their own narcissistic wound, and the parent is unaware and/or has given up on him or herself needing to mature beyond it. So, if the parent can't acknowledge their own development, their own limitations and challenges, and how they would have to confront their own wounding, their own suffering, their own pain, and really move into this place of how painful it is to not have a secure sense of self, then they're not going to touch that content to engage in it ..."

### The glue that holds this all together

* ([30:34](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=30m34s)) "the glue that's holding all of this together is that *all of us have a narcissistic wound*, so to single out this other group of people, to then elevate it to narcissistic abuse, we're not talking about narcissism, and we're not talking about abuse; *we're talking about the narcissistic wound.* That's why I've needed to create this boundary, because people don't make that distinction."
* ([33:04](https://youtu.be/bZhgMrwL4q4?t=33m04s)) "the limitation here is that, when we over identify with the persona, and the persona becomes a crutch, or the persona becomes all we know. And now we're _scrambling to present to protect our image_ and _protect how we're perceived_, and it's _all about manufacturing ourselves_, because we are so far away -- we are miles and miles away -- from even having access to a foundational truth of __*who am I, really*__?
* More to come, as I'm able ...
