Last month, South Florida jouralist Howard Goodman wrote, "We fought the big "isms" of the 20th Century -- Communism, Nazism -- because, high among the things we hated about them, was that they spied on ordinary citizens, squelched dissent and made everyone paranoid of outside enemies and unconventional neighbors."

"<a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/columnists/sfl-phoward20dec20,0,1450122.column?coll=sfla-news-col">Nothing that could ever happen here, of course</a>."

A month later, on January 19, 2006, the <a href="http://awebcamdarkly.com/docs/nsa2.pdf">NSA released a 42 page justification </a> of its actions.  Have you ever asked a kid a question about questionable behavior?  Have you ever noticed that the more they talk and the more defensive they act, the more likely it is that they've done something wrong?  All I can say is that forty-two pages of defensive legal obfuscation is a LOT of preemptive explaining by the White House.
