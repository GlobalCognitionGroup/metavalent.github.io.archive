To those who didn't have time to read between the lines on this one, the video makes it pretty clear that designated Fall Guy, Michael Brown, was completely on top of the Hurricane Katrina response and that while Brown's teammates at DHS and the White House assured, "we got your back," the only thing they really had for Brown's back was a nice shiny political stiletto. I gotta's say, leaking the video is DEFINITELY "one heck of a job, Brownie!"<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060302/ap_on_go_pr_wh/katrina_video;_ylt=Al6EMs43.mYG1JzkUA1zbFQEtbAF;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl">Video Shows Bush Warned Before Katrina Hit</a>
