"This is genius, and the best example of integration I have seen. Note that this came from game designers and not from business software developers. <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1885621,00.asp">The sooner we realize that creativity is centered in the game business, the better off the entire industry will be</a>."

In 1998 I was pretty much ostracized at Sun Microsystems for explaining this to the then fledgling "telco" group.  I explained that home-gamers would fuel the demand for bandwidth that would tranform telco to an Entirely Ethernet platform and that <a href="http://awebcamdarkly.com/2005/11/triumphal-return-of-blatently-obvious.html">consumer applications</a> would become a dominant driver of business adoption cycles.  I was slapped down, criticized, and pushed down the food chain.  I'm not saying that I could have saved Sun from its demise, but what if it *had* began anticipating this industry back then?  It's not always fully satisfying to say "I told you so."
