According to <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/lti-msp030106.php">EurekAlert</a> picked up by <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news11339.html">PhysOrg</a>, "the CLS prototype is up and running and has just produced its first X-ray beams."  Prof. Ronald Ruth adds, "We believe that the Compact Light Source will completely transform the practice of protein crystallography and significantly broaden the reach of state-of-the-art x-ray science across the board."  

Remember when IBM made the first "mini" computers by shrinking down warehouse-sized electronic brains to the size of a diesel engine that anyone could run?  It's like that, only with hundreds of times more potential for improving human health and longevity.  If this <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/niog-mci030206.php">NIH press release</a> is any indication, this is truly one of the HUGE developments that will forever change the course of human events.
