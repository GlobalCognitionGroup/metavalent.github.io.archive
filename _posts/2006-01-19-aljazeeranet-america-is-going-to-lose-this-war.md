I wonder if I'll be able to fly any more, after this one?  The proposition that I'll be put on a terrorist sympathizer list merely for posting a blog entry to Aljazeera is just a little less absurd these days; a fact that should be reason enough to raise all kinds of alarms for Americans and civil libertarians everywhere. Think about that for a second.  If you read this and think, even for a split second, that "Yeah, better safe than sorry, I probably wouldn't post something like that," then we are in some serious BIG trouble in America.  Shanks writes:<blockquote>"American resolve and our military leadership are endangered by the president of the United States."</blockquote>Writing in the Atlantic Monthly, James Fallows reports: "Time and again since the training began, inspection teams ... have visited Iraq and come to the same conclusion - the readiness of many Iraqi units is low, their loyalty and morale are questionable, regional and ethnic divisions are sharp, and their reported numbers overstate their real effectiveness."
