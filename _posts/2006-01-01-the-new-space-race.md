I guess people are just more open to thinking things anew near the first of a new year. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/28/60minutes/main1167418.shtml">The New Space Race</a> is an interview with legendary aeronautical engineer Burt Rutan. "I will predict that in 12 or 15 years, there will be tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of people that fly, and see that black sky," says Rutan."
