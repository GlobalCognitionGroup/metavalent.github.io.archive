<blockquote>"Inspired by the 150th publication anniversary of The Origin of Species, Darwinâ€™s evolutionary treatise, <a href="http://superhuman.anat.org.au/masterclass/presenters.html" target="_blank">Super Human: Revolution of the Species</a> turned the spotlight on collaborations between artists and scientists and the impact these investigations have on what it means to be human, now and into the future."</blockquote><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/47814009@N00/2943548161" title="Synapse"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3178/2943548161_91f16f1575.jpg" /></a>
