we'll find out, in time.  

one gimmick at darkly was intended to be regular use of video, using cheesy effects that cloak the identity of the vlogger. as you know, it can take quite a bit of time and $$$ to actually make any of these antics worthwhile in a way that captures and holds the public's attention, so whether or not this ever materializes remains to be seen.  although, i imagine it will have something to do with <a href="http://gabbly.com/http://awebcamdarkly.com/2004/10/wake-up-and-smell-singularity.html">this</a>.
