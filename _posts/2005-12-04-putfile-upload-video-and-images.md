As of this update, the old 2005 putfile.com seems to have become <a href="https://putfile.io/"><img src="https://putfile.io/images/putfile-logo.svg" border="0" alt="0" /></a>Another entry in the growing genre of media hosting sites. The <a href="https://putfile.io/">Putfile free account</a> now features Unlimited File Uploads at 25GB per file; whereas the original was 25MB. What a difference a decade makes in the #PostAutomationEra. :laughing:
