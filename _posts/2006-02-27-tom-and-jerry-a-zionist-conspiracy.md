As reported by Wall St. Journal's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110008021">OpinionJournal</a> it is now revealed that Hanna-Barbera's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry_%28MGM%29">Tom and Jerry</a> cartoon is actually a Zionist Plot!  The TRUTH is out there and was revealed by the Middle East Media Research Institute, Cultural Adivsor to Iranian Education Ministry and Member of Interfaith Organization.  Remember the poor kid on the schoolyard playground who always got beat up by his peers, and yet, kept doing things so annoying and flat out stupid as to make MORE PEOPLE want to beat him up?  Yeah, it's kind of like that.
