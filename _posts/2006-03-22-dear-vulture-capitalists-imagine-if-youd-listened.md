How much do you figure you'd be ahead of the pack right now?  How much money would your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETTH">plug-n-play ETTH networks</a> be worth to those now scrambling to play catch up?  Answer: A Shitload.  Too bad for Silicon Valley VC's who shined us on and now we ALL lost gigantic amounts of CASH.  Nice job on @Home Networks, though. That really worked out well for everyone, didn't it?
