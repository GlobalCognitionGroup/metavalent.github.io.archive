Wait for it ... Only Russell Brand could negate the negging of Jerry Seinfeld with this kind of flair (not the Reddit kine; real kine, Ê»ohana nui.) ROTFLMAO. Seeing isn't necessarily believing; but we can [watch and laugh anyway](https://youtu.be/xhEfbdM2Ufc?t=464).

### "Ninety-nine percent of the time, my advice, as a Life Coach is going to be ... ["Shave Your Head and Move to Phoenix"](https://youtu.be/xhEfbdM2Ufc).
<a href="https://youtu.be/BlJXdnKyfgE"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Seinfeld_Shave_Head_Phoenix_YouTube.jpg" style="float:left; vertical-align:top; margin:0px 20px" width="100"></a> Literally as seen on Fallon, two months after essentially having done exactly that; granted, the head shaving had been in place well in advance of this amatuer false prophet's pontificating. Can't make this up. Given the Comedian's Creed on theft of material, how is that one of the "greatest" comics of all time has to steal some loser nobody's life script as material? Can't make this up. LOL. :rotfl:

But, wait, there's more! Even Sam Vaknin, "[Go to Your Desert](https://youtu.be/qOh-iOaWTt8), Listen to Your Inner Silence."
