#CurationValue is generated by the unique perspectives and lenses that an individual perceiver and experiencer brings to this emerging hybrid-human-ai global cognition space.

Curation Value also provides a kind of #ManufacturedAttentionGuidanceSystem
for those learning to navigate the #PostAutomationEra exo-cortical #GlobalBrain terrain. 

Yes, _like consent, attention can become manufactured_, at a lower cognitive abstraction layer. So, if we can the manufacture the attention of an individual, a group, a nation, a world, from the first waking moment of each day, consent becomes a given.

> What could possibly go wrong, right?

With this literal godlike power becomes literal god-like responsibility. Attention and consent can be cultivated for the benefit of individuals, groups, nations, and the world; with the dividends of curation value circulated among everyone such that every individual human basic needs is met; or, it can be cultivated for the extraction of value and aggregation of wealth among a relatively small and elite group of sadomasochistic humans who get off both on the sheer corruption of their own illegitimate power, and the suffering inflicted upon others by the merciless exercise of that power.

Our curation in this post consists of a few examples of excellent curation value:
