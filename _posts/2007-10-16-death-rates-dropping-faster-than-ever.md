<blockquote>Good news on the cancer front: <a href="http://health.yahoo.com/news/180358">Death rates are dropping faster than ever</a> ... </blockquote>Also of interest are Yahoo's updated <a href="http://beta.health.yahoo.com/">Health</a> and <a href="http://beta.health.yahoo.com/longevity">Longevity</a> portals. 

<i>Tangent: Despite all the ga-ga over goo-goo, Yahoo continues it's legacy as innovation leader on the Human Values and Relevant Content fronts; not to mention it's eponymous <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">finance</a> portal, which has been the first stop for traders talking smack about stocks in the forums.</i>
