"After having overcome fascism, Nazism, and Stalinism, the world now faces a new global threat: Islamism," the manifesto says.

"<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4763520.stm">We, writers, journalists, intellectuals, call for resistance to religious totalitarianism</a> and for the promotion of freedom, equal opportunity and secular values for all." 

"The writers said they refused to accept that Muslim men and women 'should be deprived of their rights to equality, liberty or secularity in the name of respect for culture or tradition'.

They also said they would not give up their critical spirit out of fear of being accused of Islamophobia.

'Islamism is a reactionary ideology which kills equality, freedom and secularism wherever it is present,' the writers added, saying it is nurtured by fears and frustrations."
