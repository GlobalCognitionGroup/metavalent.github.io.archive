If enough people BELIEVE what they're blathering, that will be even more effective (and cost efficient) than slamming the door on innovation with litigation.  The larger issue here is the inertia of archaic intellectual property laws in a digital age.  The Day of Reckoning model seeks to keep the marketplace shackled to industrial age norms and principles, while the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> model seeks to evolve and expand intellectual property rights in a way that empowers and protects individuals and content creators far into the yet-uncharted digital future.
