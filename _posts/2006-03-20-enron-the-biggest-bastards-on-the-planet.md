I have a pretty long list of favorite movies, but this one deserves special mention.  Please, please, please, it is almost an American Civic Patriotic Duty to see this film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413845/">Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room</a>.  The fleeting TV soundbite coverage of the trials in progress don't even illuminate the tip of the iceberg about Enron.  Somehow, the major Wall St. brokers who participated in this and the personal accounts of the perpetrators of the Greatest Corporate Lies Ever Told must all be held accountable for RETURNING the money they stole.  Don't even tell me that the money is "just gone" now.  

On October 23, 2001, <a href="http://www.arthurandersen.com/">Arthur Andersen</a> shredded all of its Enron records; more than ONE TON of paper!  Andersen, <a href="http://ml.com/">Merrill Lynch</a>, <a href="http://www.chase.com/">Chase</a>, <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/">Morgan Stanley</a>, <a href="http://www.citibank.com/">Citibank</a>, <a href="http://www.credit-suisse.com/">Credit Suisse</a>, <a href="http://www.vinson-elkins.com/">Vinson &amp; Elkins LLP</a>, and the rest can FIND the damned money! All of it.  $1.2 BILLION in retirement funds and $2 BILLION in pension funds.  It is nowhere near enough to merely send a few people to white-collar tennis-camp jail for life.  Even after you watch this, you'll find yourself wondering how it happened; it's simply beyond words.
