I'm so bummed that FireAnt RC1 is still crashing on my Acer Travelmate C111 tablet.  Remember, the "Tablet OS" is no such thing at all; it's just Windows XP with various tabletty things turned on in order to recognize writing, etc.  Other than than, a tablet PC is just like any other XP laptop.  Nevertheless, there must be *something* going on in the FireAnt code that doesn't peacefully coexist with tablets.  I wrote email about this several months ago and the FireAnt team responded very quickly that they would add a tablet to their test bench, but that might have fallen through the cracks.  I don't blame them, because developing software is INSANELY DIFFICULT, but I do hope they do get around to it.
