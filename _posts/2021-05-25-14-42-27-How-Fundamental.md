"Reality may not be something that we're as in touch with us we think we are.” — Sam Harris

Sam Harris quotations:

> "It's the *seeming* that is the cash value of consciousness."

> "If anything is bad, creating hell, and populating it with real minds that can really suffer in that hell, that's bad. You are worse than any mass murderer we can name, [whether it's] in robot form or some simulation of a world, where we managed to populated with conscious minds, whether we knew they were conscious or not, and that world was in a state that was unendurable. Just like watching a person suffer for entertainment."

> "Mind, intelligence, and consciousness are ultimately substrate independent, right?"

I can't lie. It's pretty gratifying to see an intellect of the caliber of Sam Harris independently reaching similar conclusions about consciousness that we reached 20+ years ago. That's not a competition, we landed on the planet in different time frames. 

It's simply a gratifying independent finding, as is always the case in science, when someone else independent replicates our own and other colleagues results.

"Even the illusion of free will itself is an illusion. It's not that free will is wrong, it's not even wrong."— Sam Harris

> "What if people don't have ideas but ideas select people, like distributed computational nodes to run certain programs?" — Lex Fridman

> "Even the experience of an illusion is consciousness [experiencing something called an illusion]." — Sam Harris

On the topic of free will, I don't know if I've caught up with Sam yet, or if I'm completely convinced of the perspective. But certainly, being in agreement on so many other direct non-symbolic experiences makes it well worth seriously contemplating. Enjoy!

#### On anger, regret, remorse

> "What utility is there to extract out of this error signal error? How miserable do you need to be to solve your problems, in life, and to help solve the problems of people closest to you? How miserable do you need to be to get through your to-do list, today? Ultimately, I think you can be deeply happy going through all of it. Even navigating moments that are scary, and really destabilizing to ordinary people. Equanimity is so useful the moment you're in response mode." — Sam Harris
