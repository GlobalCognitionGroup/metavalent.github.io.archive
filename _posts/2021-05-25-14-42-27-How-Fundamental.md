"Reality may not be something that we're as in touch with us we think we are.” — Sam Harris

"It's the seeming that is the cash value of consciousness." — Sam Harris

I can't lie. It's pretty gratifying to see an intellect of the caliber of Sam Harris independently reaching similar conclusions about consciousness that we reached 20+ years ago. That's not a competition, we landed on the planet in different time frames. 

It's simply a gratifying independent finding, as is always the case in science, when someone else independent replicates our own and other colleagues results.

"Even the illusion of free will itself is an illusion. It's not that free will is wrong, it's not even wrong." — Sam Harris

On the topic of free will, I don't know if I've caught up with Sam yet, or if I'm completely convinced of the perspective. But certainly, being in agreement on so many other direct non-symbolic experiences makes it well worth seriously contemplating. Enjoy!
