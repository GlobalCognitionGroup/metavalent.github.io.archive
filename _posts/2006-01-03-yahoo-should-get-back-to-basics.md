Virtually nobody bothers going to <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/">search.yahoo.com</a> to get a plain search.  One of the biggest appeals of google.com is that when you get there, it's SIMPLE.  Sure, you can find more stuff if you want too, but the obvious focus on FINDING STUFF is inherent in the simplicity of its intial page.  Yahoo should adopt this strategy.  When you get to yahoo.com, the page should look like more this picture than the current, so-last-millenium "portal" page.  Let people OPT-IN to more features and modules as they want too, but the default should be SIMPLICITY.  There, I said it.
