Ever pursuing it’s own perpetual existence, the paid-hosting Wordpress content that fell offline will eventually (re)[e]merge here. Hopefully before 2016.

> _20170328 Update_: Didn’t happen. May never happen. In 2006, we began posting all of our work (generally culling the scientific literature)&nbsp;about the obvious inevitability of&nbsp;hybrid human-machine minds under&nbsp;this pseudonym, because we were accused of mental illness&nbsp;for asserting that [Neuralink](https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=neuralink&FORM=HDRSC6) would certainly be actualized within a decade or so. These weren’t idle accusations, the disdain for&nbsp;our convictions tarnished and&nbsp;damaged our reputation and career.&nbsp;Back in&nbsp;1992, the same thing happened when asserting broadband would create a whole new economic system (one we subsequently went on to help create, anyway, building infrastructure, and contributing to IEEET technical standards), back when most people could not comprehend a 1200 baud modem.&nbsp;Today,&nbsp;these scores have been&nbsp;been largely&nbsp;settled.&nbsp;But it doesn’t matter, because&nbsp;[it’s just a ride](https://youtu.be/KgzQuE1pR1w). Moreover, the value of retrieving the archives continues to diminish with insights like “Morii: [The Desire to Capture a Fleeting Experience](https://youtu.be/1asBOCAmgaw)“ and “Perhaps all anxiety might derive from a fixation on moments — an inability to accept [life as ongoing](https://twitter.com/brainpickings/status/844907854414958594).” Onward.
