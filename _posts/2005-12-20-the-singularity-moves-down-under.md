"Innocent's work relates to the idea of the evolution of the human species to a post- or trans-human state, a term often used to describe new developments in technology, the Extropian notion that the nature of consciousness will be changed by shifts in the way we communicate. Innocent takes this on as a way to refer to youth culture, which he sees as largely "game culture", and the idea of evolutionary artificial life forms that manifest through digital software or nanotechnology."
