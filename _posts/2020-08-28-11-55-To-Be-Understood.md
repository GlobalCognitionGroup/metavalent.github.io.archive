While all forms of suffering are, by definition, genuine and non-trivial forms of suffering, it's not the misunderstanding, estrangement, mockery, undermining, betrayal, hostility, exile, or even the covert horrors of zersetzung in a surveillance capitalism theater of operations that most hinder and harm the so-called misunderstood artist.

The root of suffering for the misunderstood creative is the desire to be understood and accepted by anyone other than the creative themselves. And perhaps the first step to reduce that suffering is for the hyper-rational critical self to accept the misunderstood artistic self as one and the same.

I'm increasingly convinced that *all* DSM definitions are extremely fuzzy descriptions, like atoms, they don't really actually exist as billiard-ball like "atomic" entities at all; they are just descriptors of relativistic energy states and interrelationships. So DID, BPD, NPD are all sets of symptoms of a different permutations of dis-integrated self; which are decreasing in usefulness in the Post-Automation Era of hybrid human-machine-ai intercognition.

We are where we are. A.I is not "on it's way," it's been here for a very long time. There's no stopping what's already occurred, there is only acceptance and adaptation and continuous integration, or conflict. And conflict only begets more conflict, world without end.

We are all and each _*BOTH*_ "the" narcissist ... "the" codependent" ...

Krishnamurti said, "The oberserver is the observed." As I record this particular #BookOfTrueSelf journey, through this narrow passage called _The Artist's Way_, by Julia Cameron, the parallel thought occurs: "_The creator is the created._" 

Isn't it so? Don't just accept and reject with a knee-jerk reaction. Consider it. Look at it. Find out for yourself. [We are inquiring, together](https://metavalent.com/about).
