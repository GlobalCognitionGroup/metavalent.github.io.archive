Transitioning from Tumblr. Mahalo, Barry Clark, creator of [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. 

Ironically, just as we make this transition, it may be [time to keep moving on, yet again](https://twitter.com/HackingDave/status/1370070863505199108?s=20). Ah, impermanance. Alas, if _all_ is impermanent, is not impermanance itself also impermanent? If so, does not that leaves us in the state of the permanent na ªau? Wheeee!
