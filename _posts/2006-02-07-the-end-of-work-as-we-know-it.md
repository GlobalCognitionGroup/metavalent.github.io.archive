The posted expectations of employers have reached such an absurd level of unrealistic expectation as to render a large portion of jobs out there completely worthless to ACTUAL SKILLED I.T. WORKERS.  This is a huge problem which will not be easily solved because it's so difficult to articulate in terms that others can palpably comprehend.  With no disrespect to the construction trade -- of which I am an alumni -- t's a small start to explain that the level of intellectual aptitude and focused effort required to gain even moderate competency in <a href="http://portland.craigslist.org/sad/126471389.html">this actual skill set from a representative job solicitation</a> FAR exceeds the aptitude required to scrape old paint, hang wallpaper, or hammer nails, all of which pay significantly more than the posted example.  That is not to say that construction is worth *less* but rather that in an alleged meritocracy, the economic value of a job must by definition keep pace with the economic contributions of that job.  In a growing segment of the I.T. industry, that is just not happening.
