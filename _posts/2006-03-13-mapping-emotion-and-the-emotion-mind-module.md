Increasingly, the answer appears to be, yes.  The stimulus-response mechanisms that constitute elemental human emotion are surprisingly mechanical, when  observed and measured.  We're not talking about subjective experience and engineering conciousness here -- that will come later.

From <a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=45&amp;EventId=457">Professor Mary L. Phillips</a> Mapping of Emotion to the <a href="http://mind.sourceforge.net/emotion.html">Emotion Mind-Module for Artificial Intelligence Evolving from Seed AI to Singularity AI</a>, open source computer code, we are learning more and more about this aspect of human physiology, how the physical and electro-chemical legos are shaped, snapped together, and assembled to create what we call human emotional experience. 

Machine sentience, like reaching the end of the cosmos, may be an unattainable goal, but so long as it's a goal in pursuit of which continues to yield direct benefits in the form of better human understand, treatment, and quality of life, the pace will only accelerate.
