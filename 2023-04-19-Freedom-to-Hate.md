# The freedom to hate

Let's just start with this. Nobody is going to hell. Jesus taught that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. He said if you've seen me you've seen the father. And he said to the thief on the cross next to him this day you will be with me in paradise. What this means is that the kingdom of Christ is already established on Earth as it is in heaven. The kingdom is at hand means it is right here, right now, in this present moment.

You can ask, how can that be with all the poverty and hatred and bloodshed and war? Easy. Free will. Nobody has to live in the Kingdom of Heaven that is right here in present moment, right here, right now. You can kill me if you would like, for speaking these words. You have the free will to hate me and kill me, just as the centurions had the free will to hate Jesus and crucify him.

You are free to diagnose me with the psychological condition. To say I suffer from a martyr complex. To say that I claim that I too am Jesus christ. Those are all lies but you are free to protect those lies upon me. You have the free will to tell lies about me.

You have the free will to cast a net of words to attempt to ensnare me in some kind of contradiction or hypocrisy. Especially knowing that we live in a dualistic material realm characterized by paradox and contradiction. Bubbling up from a Quantum probability cloud of one and zeros at the same time. It makes no sense that a Quantum bit is one in zero at the same time and yet believing it or not does not make it less true.

Nobody is going to hell. Nobody is going to heaven. There is not a future state that we're striving to get to. That is a misperception of linear time within the context of timeless eternity. 

It's an understandable misunderstanding. Our scientific method focused on measuring the material realm for the past 2,000 years and finally completed the standard model of physics with the confirmation of the Higgs boson at 125 giga electron volts (GeV), thereby completing a 100% mathematically consistent and accurate description of about four and a half percent of all that is within the realm of our human perception.

For the moment, we refer to the rest of the stuff, the 95% or so, as dark matter and dark energy. The truth of the matter is is we don't know what it is, and there are no falsifiable theories to prove the existence one way or the other.

I would submit that the case that the culmination of all of humanity's best scientific thinking over the last two millennia summing up in the present moment to about a 4% understanding of the universe, is grounds for some humility.

And maybe you have faith that there will become falsifiable theories, soon, and you can point to work that is underway, and you can point that by inference we can know for sure that this unknowable stuff will become knowable, and that's good, because that brings us into a common ground, of faith.

You are a person of faith. I am a person of faith. We are all people of faith. Even if that faith is in our own individual ability to think and interact in a world that makes us feel good about ourselves. That means you have faith in yourself. That's a good thing. Faith, by the definition is universal. So, attacking and excluding anyone for their faith, regardless of where they choose to put it, is unjustifiable.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion, right?

Except for that one. Except for them.

Love your neighbor as yourself.

Except for that one. Except for them.

Many of us choose to put our faith in the scientific method. To be intellectually honest, we must concede that we have no rational provable concrete evidence of the 95.5% that remains inexplicable at the present moment. The only honest answer we can offer is that we don't know, but we'd like to know. We hope. We have hope that something will emerge that will describe our so-called reality a little more accurately, a lot more accurately, and eventually including the rest of that 95.5%. 

So, we possess or at least profess the non-symbolic substance called hope. We all have some form of hope in common. Scientists and spiritual people alike practice faith and hope.

Now Jesus said that these three things abide: faith, hope, and charity. Charity meaning the kind of love that cares for other human beings. I expect that many of us consider ourselves to be good people with good intentions towards others and therefore charitable in our thoughts and our actions. Volunteering, contributing, giving to causes we believe in. These are all charitable acts of charitable people.

And so most of us, I would say, you and I at least, have at least these three things in common: faith, hope, and charity.

So, if we all, universally share these three fundamental aspects of everyday mundane existence, there can be no grounds to attack anyone for the characteristics that we ourselves hold as self-evident.

To attack anyone on the grounds of their faith, hope, or charity, is to attack ourselves. 

Nevertheless, despite the contradiction, we are within our right to be contradictory people. We're within our cognitive liberty rights to criticize people who have faith and hope in God. To mock them, to be rate them, to demean them, to dismiss them, to dehumanize them, to exclude them from our definition of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

We are 100% within our rights to do so.

Now, we can consider faith as the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. We can have faith as the substance of our hope in mathematics figuring out something about this 95.5% of whatever is going on. We can present that as our evidence of things not seen.

We are also within our rights to criticize people for placing their faith and hope in some non-symbolic, non-falsifiable claim. We are within our rights to criticize and condemn and even disdain and diminish people for putting their faith in non-falsifiable symbolic claims, or non-falsifiable non-symbolic claims.

Non falsifiable is non falsifiable. There are non-falsifiable falsifiables, and non-falsifiables and non-falsifiables.

This is what makes our Faith and Hope substantially equivalent, in essence, and therefore in actuality.

We can express strong Faith and Hope in non falsifiable scientific claims. We can believe that these claims will eventually bear themselves out and become falsifiable, even if they are not so in the present moment. We can have faith and hope. And we do. We have scientific faith and hope. Both based on non falsifiable claims.

We can express strong Faith and Hope in non-falsifiable non-symbolic, non mathematical, spiritual claims. We can believe that these claims will eventually bear themselves out and become falsifiable, incontrovertible, even if they are not so in the present moment.

So what are the grounds for hating and excluding people based upon where they place their Faith and Hope?

We can hate god. We can hate religion. We can hate science. We can hate reason. We all have the free will to hate whatever we want on whatever grounds that we want. We are free to hate. My only question is, why would you make that choice, when given the choice? Because we have all been given that choice. We can also choose to admit that life is beyond our understanding, aided by artificial intelligence or not, and to maybe pause the hate just for a minute to contemplate that mystery.
