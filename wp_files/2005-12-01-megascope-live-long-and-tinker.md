<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/BizTech/wtr_14840,295,p1.html"><img src="http://awebcamdarkly.com/images/tr.logo.gif" border="0" alt="" /></a>At the decrepit old age of 45, I've already experiened dozens of cases of younger people assuming that I won't be able to keep up with their obviously superior wit and wisdom.  The blatent ageism has cost me jobs and contracts, but the cost and energy of litigation makes retaliation pointless.  The problem with companies who harbor these groups of cute and shiny ageist bigots is that companies are losing out on the much-more-likely-to-be-profitable Innovations Born of Experience such as those described in this MIT brief.

"Many creative people have stayed inventive their whole lives--by redirecting their talents and experience."  <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/BizTech/wtr_14840,295,p1.html">MIT Technology Review</a>
