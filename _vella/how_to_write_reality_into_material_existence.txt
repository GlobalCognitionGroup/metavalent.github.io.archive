How To Write Reality Into Material Existence

    
The observable universe is an ensemble of worlds like our solar system, created by the accidental collision of particles, a world like the one we observe around us. It is a universe tuned to intelligent life. The universe is just a random member of this ensemble, an extraordinary event, like a horse that comes into existence through accidental collisions of particles: there is no probable nature, and constant quantities fall within the range of the random-infinitesimal-of-life-permissible. The most likely observable universe would be one in which a single brain fluctuates in existence in a quantum vacuum, observed as in an empty world. But it's also the least likely: it's a wondrous ensemble of worlds as we observe it. [Sources: 4] 
    
This view of the material world bears a number of different names: materialism, physicalism and naturalism, to name but a few. According to this view, everything in the world exists as the physical content of time and space. [Sources: 4] 
    
One thing I agree with idealists and materialists: there is no dualistic sense to our question. What both views have in common is that we share the same reality. We should beware of the idea that the nature of reality is relative to what someone else believes. For Berkeley, for example, the "nature" of my reality and your reality is the same as it is, because they are both constructed by the mind and dependent on ideas. Let's say I think the earth is flat and you think it's round. [Sources: 0] 
    
The only thing mathematics says clearly is that there should be truths, and the part of mathematics I am talking about is the necessary truth. But we're not talking about that here. We are talking about things that are by their very nature either true or false. And I'm happy to give some kind of reality to all these things. [Sources: 6] 
    
Ard: There is beauty, but it's hard to be sure how you perceive beauty. Beauty, of course, is a very personal thing, and people have different views. But I think beauty is a clear guide to the truth. [Sources: 6] 
    
That's true, but I don't think it's a question of what works in society. I think you have to look at what people do right and wrong, but the question is what makes society work. David: It's a matter of fashion. [Sources: 6] 
    
The moral ones on which I seem to depend, I am not sure if they have anything to do with the existence of consciousness. I mean, without conscious beings, the idea of morality seems to disappear. [Sources: 6] 
    
For me, consciousness leads to self-discovery of the truth of matter, whether dead or unconscious. I am not a writer of faith. I do not see how a non-living rock can induce someone to write philosophical truths that will one day be taken as a leitmotif to make them a reality for consciousness. [Sources: 3] 
    
The so-called reality is nothing other than the ideas that the solipsist has created. The options, beliefs and ideals of reality exist. The thoughts and concepts that exist are his own thoughts and consciousness that exist. [Sources: 2] 
    
The problem with idealism is Descartes's belief that we can only cling to one empirical truth: that something exists. We think what we perceive with our senses, and we think that we perceive what our senses give us as proof that there is a universe outside our own mind and that evidence exists outside our mind, but the problem is that this can only be verified in the realm of thought. Dogmatic begins with the assumption that material objects and thoughts (the belief that space is inseparable) are conditioned by objects in space that do not exist in space. She says that things in space do not exist without images. [Sources: 1] 
    
We have a set of thoughts, and there is a universal set of gods. God thinks of himself and all others. He thinks of us when we are sitting in a room with other people at our computers, and at the same time he thinks of the room of people with computers, and everyone in that room has a thought in their head. [Sources: 1] 
    
This methodological solipsism goes so far as to say that everything we perceive in the brain is part of the outside world, and it is only through our senses that we can see and feel outside the mind. The existence of thought is known only to those who can be sure. [Sources: 2] 
    
The scientific method in the sense of prediction, observation, modification, loops, etc. does not require assumptions about the outside world. The method of the typical scientist is materialistic, since he or she assumes that the world exists and can be known. When a solipsist performs a psychological test in which he recognizes the essence of reality in his mind, David Deutsch uses this to confront those who argue that the outer part of the solipsist behaves as if he were an independent, clearly defined conscious self. [Sources: 2] 
    
Theoretically, there is no objective knowledge of all aspects of reality. A theory like the Ptolemy model is a construction; in it every being is supposed to represent a night sky in every direction. It says nothing about the true aspect of reality, such as the composition of planets or objects. [Sources: 5] 
    
The abstract aspects of space are captured in some of Euclid's axioms, which can be altered without excluding the entire Euclid geometric framework upon which the modelling of reality is based. The reconstruction of the world is a fundamental aspect of relativity, a fundamental relational aspect. Mathematics is a mechanical language, but it is also mechanical. It is the beauty of eliminating empirical changes through various operations (kee) that the only thing that cannot be eliminated is the existence of things. [Sources: 5] 
    
This is not a complete answer to our questions, but it is a fact that we cannot ignore. Second, at least in reality, we can see that the nature of reality is not what the world appears to an individual. At least we can say that this is not the case. [Sources: 0] 
    
As Wittgenstein, Davidson and Strawson emphasized, the development of language and thought does not take place in isolation. The rule is solipsism, the view of reality as it is a function of my private experience. This is the mistaken belief that other states of mind, which the solipsist regards as the only furniture in his world, depend on a common environment. [Sources: 0] 
    
On the one hand, my own consciousness is the only element of existence I am aware of. In the flow of subjective experience, I perceive an outer reality, and I demarcate it. The subjective itself is difficult to objectify. The totality of perception, including memory, is unreliable and misleading (chap. [Sources: 7]
