Amazon Vella'S Implications For Self-Publishing With Respect To Author Opportunity And Content Quality

    
A survey of 1,007 self-published authors, one of the most comprehensive insights into this growing market to date, found that a small percentage of authors bring home sums in excess of $100,000, with an average income of $10,000 a year. This number tends to be among the top earners, with less than 10% of self-publishing authors earning more than 75% of reported income and half of authors earning less than $500. In the United States, the median household income in the US is $52K per year, and the average US indie author earns less than 100% of the lifetime of his books. [Sources: 6] 
    
I doubt that less than 100% of indie authors join these organizations. In large digital bookstores, indie titles are listed side by side with published books. I'm not saying all published books are equally good, but the average indie title is complete trash. Quality is expected in a published book. This includes great editing, cover art, formatting and translations abroad. [Sources: 6] 
    
In the traditional publishing model, publishers act as filters and screens that weed out radicals who write inferior content. By contrast, self-publishing allows authors to bypass these filters and sell their books directly to the public. The open and uncensored nature of self-published content can cause problems and controversy, especially with pornographic, abuse-related content. Amazon has a policy against the sale of content related to rape, incest and bestiality, declaring that it does not accept pornographic or offensive depictions of graphic sexual acts, and it can be difficult for booksellers to distinguish which types of content are acceptable and which are not.

The review of self-published content is part of its overall strategy to empower consumers by providing more information on how it allows reviews of its products, including the books it sells. It is possible that self-publishing authors are playing Amazon's review system to make their books appear better than they actually are, by encouraging a large number of five-star reviews by paying anonymous reviewers to write bogus commendations.

Books for sale in the Kindle Store are self-published by authors. The Kindle Store offers a high percentage of royalties, and e-book prices are lower than for printed books. This appeals to readers who don't want to throw $15 at an author they've never heard of. Books for e-readers are a quality product that is no different from what major publishers bring out.

To give yourself the best chance of success on Amazon and other platforms, your title needs to garner a healthy dose of book sales and reviews before it is published. Much depends on how well the book performs in its first few weeks on the market. [Sources: 4] 
    
If you want your ideal customer to pick up your book and know and trust you to guide your funnel through your program, self-publishing covers are not for everyone. With the odd exception of cover design, Amazon is a Fiverr investment and a cup of coffee away from the screaming "self-published" in the corporate world, and if there's a way to get anything out of the way, it's never a good thing. One can say, with the best of intentions, that Amazon's view as the go-to platform for book publishing lacks real substance or validity: the entire publishing process is simple, basic data input followed by a few simple clicks, and even the most successful traditional and hybrid publishers do not (among other things) devote entire departments and huge budgets to cover design. Because Amazon lacks a formula, or even a basic guide, on what works best for a particular genre, call, or audience, you are left to your own devices, hoping for the best. [Sources: 1] 
    
Every now and then, Amazon reminds authors that they have the keys to the till in their hands and changes the rules. It is impossible to predict what new perks and programs Amazon will release in the coming years, but the top of the e-book and book market seems to be the top priority. Authors have control over many things: registration with KDP Select, packaging of books, and quality of content. Successful authors focus on these factors and experiment with programs like KDP Selected to determine the best path to success for their titles. [Sources: 0] 
    
What makes the Kindle a key entry point, of course, is Amazon's reach as a retailer and its vast stock of self-publishers already available to KDP. Canada's Wattpad, launched a year before the Kindle in November 2006, is familiar to international audiences from a journalistic point of view. It advertises its gigantic serialized story platform to a monthly audience of 90 million people, with an average session time of 52 minutes and 2.3 billion minutes spent on the platform, 90 percent of the minutes spent by Generation Z and millennial users, 70-80 percent of whom are female. Publishers will want to keep an eye on this, as it could create a new dynamic in Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) and facilitate the primary location for writers "self-published activities.

One notable controversy of late has been the placement of tables of contents in books for those enrolled. Some authors have placed a link at the beginning of their e-books that leads the reader to a table of contents on the back of the book. Since the number of pages a reader reads is a payout-based measure (note that the widest page of a book a reader can see), some believe that authors are cheating the system by pushing readers to the end of their books. As it turns out, this is not as effective as many believe. [Sources: 0] 
    
To give you an idea of the money you can expect from each copy sold, let us take a look at the royalties offered to independent and published authors. An author who publishes a book can expect an APR of 5%. An indie author can see between 20% and 50%, depending on the printing costs. A published author could see somewhere between 20% and 25% net retail sales cuts. The advantage is that, as we have already indicated, self-published authors, rather than bearing the most costs, can get the most loot. [Sources: 4] 
    
Specific factors include, but are not limited to, credit production, balance sheet management levels, net interest margins, ability to control costs and expenses, interest rates, changes in the competitive environment, US government financial regulation policies, water management issues in California, and general economic conditions. Additional information regarding these and other factors that could affect financial results is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any obligation to update these factors, whether as announced or as a result of revisions to the forward-looking statements contained herein, to reflect future events or developments.
