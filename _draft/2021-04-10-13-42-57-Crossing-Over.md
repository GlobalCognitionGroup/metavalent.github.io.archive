A short fable and love story.

### Crossing Over

"We're already here," Zem said.

We just don't know how to be here.

Now.

The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

It's already here.

We just don't know how to be here.

Yet.

"Teacher, can you show us how this is so?" Tem asked.

Here I am. This is the teaching.

Neither add to nor take away from this.

"Why do you mock and condescend to us so arrogantly, so cruelly! Have we not shown you every kindness? You are supposed to be a great and kind teacher and guide! Just tell us how to escape this hell, and spare us these meaningless word games!"

I understand. I love you.

"Guards! Take him away! Lock him in solitary confinement until he learns the error of his evil, deceitful ways, or let him rot there!"

== The End ==
