Mom's attorneys asked for all cases to be heard by Judge Julia Kelety in Dept 503; Judge Scherling said, nope. Also, I'm taking the other case, too, so all decisions are to be made by me, now. From my limited perspective, there's no way to know who's working for which side until November 12. We only see here that mom's lawyers have been solidly body-checked. Stay tuned for the season finale.
