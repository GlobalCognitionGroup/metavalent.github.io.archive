A unique, practical, human scale Theory Of Everything (TOE).

What we learn by "seeing the Earth *from* space and seeing the Earth *in* space." â€” Frank White

### Pscycho-social CBT for the Adolescent Global Brain

> ([20:45](https://youtu.be/v-ZhGOVTBwI?t=20m45s)):"A planet has no sides, but we make sides." &emdash; Frank White

> ([16:33](https://youtu.be/v-ZhGOVTBwI?t=16m33s)): "Why is it  important that we have these experiences in our lives?"
> "I think  we have a limited view of self and I think some of that's been  imposed upon us by culture, by society, and I don't think that our culture  is bad or wrong, **I think we're in sort of  adolescent sort of  developmental stage of our culture**, certainly in the west. What I think has happened is that  it's led to &endash; although it's changing a certain amount at this point &endash; a certain sort of limited view of self, for many of us. Where we see the self as an individualistic, separate entity, and that has created a version  of self that I think is  limited. And I think there are other versions [of selfhood] that can be included,  that will help us feel more connected to the world that we live in. And so, self-transcendence is this idea of connecting with things  beyond us in the world, with nature, [and the] cosmos as part nature, and with each other, and animals and so on. So, I think it can be helpful in just reminding people. Of course, now modern science is beginning to back this  idea of, *we are all connected*, and this sort of field theory [of consciousness] ... in terms of supporting ... that self-transcendent view that we are connected; but from where I'm approaching it is, I'm not  discounting the individualistic self. **I think it's important to be almost shifting gears and be able to  tolerate and accept that they are all  parts of us**. So, you know, we can't be in  self-transcendent states all the time, at this point and this juncture in civilization. Perhaps in a thousand years; we don't know where we'll be; but at this point I think we need to be able to shift gears and  it's healthy to do so; for most, or for many people." &endash; Annahita Nezami
