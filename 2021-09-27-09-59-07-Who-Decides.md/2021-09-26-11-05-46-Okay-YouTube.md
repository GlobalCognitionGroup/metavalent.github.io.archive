Feature Request: YouTube Voice Commands

In order to more easily curate abridged works, I'd like the ability to say, "Okay YouTube ... copy the transcription from 16 minutes 33 seconds to 18 minutes 45 seconds" have that captured to the clipboard.

Anyone who does a lot of work with YouTube videos can readily imagine your own set of voice commands that would be specific within the YouTube environment. Feel free add your suggestions in the comments.
