What is Metavalent Stigmergy? I propose that [Metavalent Stigmergy](https://patreon.com/metavalent) is the process by which new default consensus realities instantiate.

If Picasso worked with words and non-symbolic concepts instead of paint, and had access to a kind of fledgling global brain, of sorts, what might h have created? Am I arrogantly equating myself to Picasso with such a question? Maybe. Or, I'm acknowledging some kinds of similar afflictions of perception and interaction with my environment, a lifelong schizoid kind of desire for some semblance of a space within which I can hear my own thoughts; or what appears to subjective consciousness as "one's own creative voice," as distinct from the overwhelming invasion of demanding thoughts of all of the humans surrounding me. 

> As of this writing, the global default consensus _narrative of pandemic_ is receding by way of the _narrative of vaccination_, and this post-pandemic moment is oft referred to in the media as The Great Reset. The nurseries for these collective meta narratives is often places like Davos, where, in contrast to conspiracy theories, people would be amazed to find out out arbitray and ad-hoc The Story co-creation and co-editing actually is. Global billionaires are all far too competitive and narcissistic to all sit down in a room like at a sitcom writers writing table and hammer out some kind of world script. It's more like a sequence of completely intutitive and interative metavalent stigmergic utterances of "that sounds about right," between conversational agents each acting in their own self-interest, first and foremost. The the extent that self-interest enlightened, it's actually not such a bad way for complex adaptive system to narrate it's own story. Alas, it is the evident lack of enlightenment, as evidenced by the contuation of the brutality of war, avoidable famine, climate catastrophe, and so on, which give the public rightful cause to question and even demand that the people and processes that have led humanity into its current predicament, be held to account.

These are some of the typical conditions facing humanity, from this writer's perspective, at the dawn of this ​[Post-Automation Era](http://postautomationera.com/). So, for the moment, I want to circle back just once more to where we began.

​Since the late 1990's and early 2000's I've been captivated by this phenomenon -- one micro-instance of which is described, above -- that I eventually dubbed metavalent stigmergy. The principle began to become evident to me during architecture and construction of ​[the world's first gigabit fiber-optic Ethernet to the Home networks](https://web.archive.org/web/19990125085716/http://fiberhood.net/), in Palo Alto, and then clarified by the time I ​[registered the domain name](https://www.whois.com/whois/metavalent.com) in 2007.
​
​The term _metavalent stigmergy_ was inspired by my own direct observations, experience, and informed by countless authors, academics, cultural practitioners, scientists, philosophers, and especially the most marginalized others I could find, who all shared the common quest to understand what we used to refer to as "the future," (more later, on why I largely reject the validity of that term, these days), as a means of making optimally informed choices for the maximum benefit of all sentient beings in the present. The concept of metavalence was inspired by Philip K. Dick's concept of an over-valent idea, described in The Transmigration of Timothy Archer. Stigmergy, "is a mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions," and best understood as the way ants communicate. The insight that came to mind in the late 1990's and become more clearly formed during the early 2000's was that metavalent stigmergy is the process, the means and methods, by which new consensus realities instantiate on planet Earth, through human to human interaction.

Today, I extend this definition to include all sentient beings, and our extended, disembodied cognition spaces throughout the internet, including our artificially intelligent colleagues, artilects, if you will. Alas, this also introduces several abstraction layers of complexity that will still take some years to unpack, provided that this writer's time on Earth is granted to complete the work in process, or at least make a bit more progress toward understanding, prior to being inevitably, abruptly, removed from the material realm, such is as common to humans. We all, eventually, face death, and would do well to acknowledge so, as Ernest Becker compassionately pleas in his classic book, The Denial of Death. It is our individual and collective denial of death, suggests Becker, that leads to much, if not all of humanity's greatest suffering.

If you've read this far, I'm deeply impressed and honored. Thank you for your interest, attention, curiosity, and perseverance. The subjects we've touched upon here are among the subjects of our Open Inquiry, but by no means does this define any kind of limit to the exploration of consciousness. As always, I invite you to share your own investigations, intuitions, and insights, that we may grow in mutual understanding, and assist one another in the journey of awakening together.

"A mind that demands experience is really living in the past, and therefore can never possibly understand something totally new, original. So there must be freedom from that urge for experience. Do you understand? You know this is going to be tremendously arduous, to go into this kind of meditation, because we all want rather easy, comfortable, happy, you know, an easy going life. And so when something difficult, which demands your attention, your energy, you say, “Well that is not for me, I’ll go another way" (Jiddu Krishnamurti).

So, perhaps some the best things we can attempt as interstitial guerilla-wordfare-uplift-agents and interdimensional negativity-counter-insurgents is to practice:

* Holding Digital & Physical Space with SERENITY
* Removing Online & Offline Obstacles with KINDNESS
* Reading and Listening Deeply with UNDERSTANDING
* Seeing and Responding Clearly with COMPASSION

But none of this airy fairy rainbow pony unicorn poop is even close to possible without deeply and fully acknowledging and sitting with all of my own greatest ANXIETY and deepest DENIAL, right? Life is not a fashion show. It's not a beauty or popularity contest. It's about learning how to die with something that approximates authentic meaning and dignity, right in the midst of a realm that often appears entirely devoid of either.
