Since the early 2000's I've been captivated by a phenomenon that I dubbed [metavalent stigmergy(https://patreon.com/metavalent). Inspired by my own direct observations, experience, and informed by countless authors, academics, cultural practitioners, scientists, philosophers, and especially the most marginalized _others_ I could find who shared the common quest to understand what we used to refer to as "the future," (more later, on why I largely reject the validity of that term, these days), as a means of making informed choices in _the present_; the concept of metavalence was inspired by Philip K. Dick's concept of an over-valent idea, described in The Transmigration of Timothy Archer. Stigmergy, "is a mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions," and best understood as the way ants communicate. The insight that came to mind in the late 1990's and become more clearly formed during the early 2000's was that metavalent stigmergy is the process, the means and methods, by which new consensus realities instantiate on planet Earth, through human to human interaction.

Today, I extend this definition to include all sentient beings, but this also introduces several abstraction layers of complexity that will still take some years to unpack, provided that this writer's time on Earth is granted to complete the work in process, or at least make a bit more progress toward understanding, prior to being inevitably, abruptly, removed from the material realm, such is as common to humans. We all, eventually, face death, and would do well to acknowledge so, as Ernest Becker compassionately pleas in his classic book, The Denial of Death. It is our individual and collective denial of death, suggests Becker, that leads to much, if not all of humanity's greatest suffering.

These are among the subjects of our open inquiry. As always, I invite you to share your own, that we may grow in mutual understanding, and assist one another in the journey of awakening together. Yes, material IRL moral support makes all the difference to our ability to continue materially existing on this plane, doing this work that we love. Please [pitch in at Patreon](https://patreon.com/metavalent), as you can. Also one-time recognitions of value can be sent via CashApp to $JustBePono. Mahalos!
